' thanks to advances in dna we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself . ' sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play .

' ' we do n't ever give up . all the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they 're reviewed at regular intervals .

' it may have been that he misjudged the speed and thought it was safe to do so , but the true motive will never be known . ' he said had mr hicks jumped out when it was stationary at lights there would be no permanent damage . mr hicks had gotten into the taxi at the orange grove rank in bath ( pictured ) in 2010 with his girlfriend . ' i have broadly accepted the evidence of the defendant and therefore find that his intention was not to do anything other than to return him to the rank where he would be released , ' he added . ' this is the kind of conduct which creates a significant risk to life and limb as this case demonstrates . ' the judge said it was a ' stark and unattractive choice ' to decide between the two - and concluded there should be a 50 per cent reduction in the damages payable to mr hicks . he was also entitled to a further \u00a3250 for unlawful imprisonment . lawyers representing mr hicks said the incident left him with ' devastating ' brain injuries and he is now being cared for by his mother gill . speaking at the time the claim was lodged with the high court , james davies , said : ' whilst he has undergone extensive treatment and rehabilitation , he has developed post-traumatic epilepsy , headaches , fatigue , suffers social and behavioural problems and has no sense of taste or smell . ' he is reliant on 24-hour care from his mum and is unable to work . ' both sides were given permission to appeal and a further hearing will determine the amount which mr young will have to pay . ",

' a big set of balls . i 've just got to come forward and go out there and dominate him , ' he said . ' machida likes to run around and dance and do his thing . i 've just got to cut him off , slowly progress and be the bull . he tries to be the matador \u2013 sometimes you 've got to play one role or the other and this is the time to be the bull and slowly progress , put him in a bad spot and make him fight my fight . ' i 've seen little things that he does n't like \u2013 there 's plenty of other fights too that i 've seen that show a lot of holes and areas where i can take advantage of . ' you see fights where guys stand in the middle ground too long \u2013 i 've just got to make him think about everything . i 'm a true mixed martial artist ; i have everything to my game . he 's got to think about me taking him down , and then my kicks and my punches and everything that i bring to the table . ' machida has got a very small avenue to win this fight on the feet . other than that , my avenue is quite big comparably to his.. . he does n't really have much of a chance on the ground . rockhold performs during an open workout as he bids to extend his winning streak to five . machida lands a side kick as he works out in front of fans and media . ' i 'll be operating at a different frequency than him \u2013 he does n't have the hip movement and the speed to keep up with me . ' and while rockhold afforded machida his respect , he has no plans to let it get in the way of victory . ' i think there is a mutual respect between machida and me \u2013 i respect what he does , ' he said . ' he 's one of the best in the game and has been for a long , long time . ' he 's right here at the top , where he 's been for the whole of his career . he 's a martial artist \u2013 he lives by the code . a lot of people love his fighting style , a lot of people hate his fighting style , but you have to respect his fighting style . ' i respect what he does and i like a lot of the things he does . but at the same time , i 'm going to go out there and show him my style and dominate . ' i 've been running marathons every day so i 'm ready to go in there and chase him down . ' rockhold 's last victory came against michael bisping last november in australia . machida is also coming off the back of a victory , against cb dollaway in brazil . machida , meanwhile , is confident he can upset rockhold and earn himself a title shot . ' i think if i apply my style , my technique , i can stop luke , you know , ' he said . ' if i can do my strategy , i can win the fight . ' i know there was another fight in line for the title shot - jacare vs yoel romero \u2013 but now , whoever wins out of me and luke \u2013 deserves a title shot i think . ' i can see a couple of weaknesses in luke but it 's hard to say before the fight , it 's hard to foresee the fight . i have to be there to feel the fight- to see any mistakes he makes . ' i am very well prepared for this fight . i had eight weeks of camp and i had great training . glover [ teixeira ] was there and many , many other fighters . so i am feeling very well , very calm , and i think i can do a great job .

        "document": "a sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped . domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . in february he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence . but today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sentence dropped : domenico rancadore ( right and left ) fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in italy for his role as a ' man of honour ' . although his conviction remains intact , italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed . the case will still have to be heard by the italian supreme court , according to the crown prosecution service ( cps ) . rancadore 's solicitor , karen todner said : ' yesterday the italian court of appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction of domenico rancadore on the basis that the conviction is too old to sustain a prison sentence . ' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .",

' for me now it 's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25-year-old said in an interview with bbc northern ireland . ' there 's something special i can achieve going into augusta this year . you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions . not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome . it would just be incredible . ' you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much . i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . ' mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round . mcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month . but the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket . ' during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added . ' if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time . if i was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed . ' and not just one . i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on . obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . ' mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel . but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year . mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles . ' i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added . ' if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much . ' but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot . i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position . ' luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out . i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . ' mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february . mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came he called off his wedding to caroline wozniacki . and he hopes he can again use the golf course as his ' sanctuary ' from the pressure and hype surrounding augusta . ' the golf course was my sanctuary , it was where i could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours that i am out there and it helped . it really did , ' he added . ' i was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and i think it will be the same at augusta because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen . ' i know i wo n't be able to wait until thursday morning or afternoon and just get on the golf course and play golf . there is only so much you can talk about it and then you have to go out and try and play .

' it just shows the extent of people 's ignorance , ' mrs jackson , from las vegas , said . the 35-year-old said she is also subjected to taunts in the street , with other mother 's accusing her of burning rj . ' his skin is bright red and shiny , ' mrs jackson added . ' i put vaseline all over him two to three times a day to keep his skin subtle but he is still sore . ' when he was younger he had to have it over his body every few hours \u2013 even in the night . ' we have n't known sleep for about five years .

' she said sharply to me , `` excuse me , your child has caught the sun '' . ' i could n't believe it . but we 're used to the staring and ignorant comments . ' i think he is the most beautiful boy in the world . ' he 's got a cheeky smile and an adorable giggle .

' we were in walmart in las vegas putting his creams on when we were surrounded by five armed police . netherton 's syndrome is a rare congenital skin disease - a more extreme form of ichthyosis . sufferers ' skin appears red and scaly and can also experience hair , infection and allergy problems . because red skin can be attributed to several diseases , the condition may not be accurately diagnosed until later in a child 's life . most children with the disease appeared ' scalded ' at birth and are slow to gain weight . their skin quickly loses heat , water and protein and babies are often kept in incubators on special care baby units as a result . they are more at risk of infection because of their inflammed skin . parents are advised to reguarly cleanse and moisturiser their child'skin , while taking care when holding them . there is no cure for the condition , but in most infants , the symptoms improve with time . as they get older , a child 's skin may remain red and scaly , and their skin may be itchy , sensitive or raw , sometimes appearing thicker at the joints . the condition appears out of the blue where there has been no family history . but , it is thought to be genetic , and parents can carry the faulty gene responsible . source : ichthyosis support group .

' mrs jackson , who is married to rj 's father reginald , 40 , said their son was diagnosed when he was a baby . ' after an emergency caesarean , i knew something was n't right , ' she said . ' as rj was lifted up and i saw him for the first time , i noticed an angry rash on his chest . ' he was rushed to intensive care where the rash seemed to spread before our eyes , his skin becoming even redder and cracking . ' she said her first thought was he was being burnt by the incubator light . ' but he was n't , ' she said . ' no one had any idea what was wrong with him . ' when doctors told me i could take him home two weeks later , i burst into tears . ' i did n't think he was well enough to leave hospital . his skin was crusty and starting to fall off . ' back home , as he cried and screamed , i felt helpless , and wished there was something i could do . ' he 'd scratch at his skin until it bled , so i put socks on his hands to stop him . ' i searched the internet for answers but i could n't find anything . ' she eventually stumbled upon a facebook group called netherton 's syndrome research group . it had been set up by a couple in the uk whose child , jack oldacres has the condition . ' each symptom was exactly like rj 's , ' mrs jackson said . ' people from all over the world were sharing stories , swapping tips to help one another . ' i knew this was what he had . i found out netherton 's was a rare strain of the skin condition ichthyosis , affecting one in 200,000 births in the uk . mrs jackson was desperate to discover what was wrong with rj , centre on his sister 's lap , and so turned to the internet . there , she found a facebook group set up by the parents of a little boy with the disease . ' each symptom was exactly like rj 's , ' she said . ' i knew this was what he had ' . ' reginald and i started slathering rj 's skin in vaseline every three hours , like people on the group suggested . ' we bathed him just twice a week because the hard water dried out his skin too much . ' each time i 'd sit with him in the bath and painstakingly remove all the dead skin . ' but , she said , people are still critical of her . ' i 'm happy to explain what netherton 's is , but most people jump to conclusions before i get the chance , ' she said . ' his brother and sisters are great with him , always helping out and standing up for him . ' just like any other little boy , he loves throwing around a ball and is usually bubbly and happy , until his skin starts to hurt . ' right now , rj is too young to know that people make nasty comments , but i hope as he grows , his condition will be better known . ' it does n't matter how red his skin is , all i see is a beautiful little boy . '  ",

' we have received one complaint about it and we will be guided by the committee of advertising practice ( cap ) and advertising standards authority ( asa ) if a similar advert were to be submitted again . ' we have zero tolerance towards graffiti on the network and take action to prevent it and remove it . ' the removal of the posters comes as a protest organised against protein world in hyde park on may 2 gathers steam - hundreds of people are expected to attend the rally in central london . the posters have caused a huge backlash on social media , with thousands of tweets directed at the campaign . one user called catrin stewartwrite : ' you clearly know what you 're trying to sell with that offensive , unrealistic and sexist advert . ' another called livy christophers \u200fsaid : ' you do n't get to tell women what is offensive . `` are you beach body ready '' really means `` why do n't you look like this . `` ' online fitness store protein world , who claim that the image is entirely unphotoshopped , have been actively engaging in the furore on social media , strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved tweeters . online fitness store protein world , who claim that the image is entirely unphotoshopped , have been actively engaging in the furore on social media , strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved tweeters .

' why make your insecurities our problem ? ' tv presenter susanna reid described the campaign for protein shakes , which features a toned swimwear-clad model alongside the slogan ' are you beach body ready ? ' , as ' anxiety inducing ' during an interview with the fitness brand 's head of global marketing on monday morning . the good morning britain presenter and her co-host ben shephard grilled richard staveley about the uproar surrounding the poster , which has attracted the wrath of many social media users . many have been outraged that the advert appears to suggest women can not go on the beach in a bikini unless they look like the slim model in the advert . ' what if my only goal is to be on a beach ? ' , susanna asked richard , adding , ' am i irrational by finding that advert a little bit anxiety inducing ? ' weighing in on the debate : susanna reid revealed she found the controversial protein world advert ' anxiety inducing ' on good morning britain on monday . security threat : staveley revealed police were investigating a bomb threat made to the company . the protein world boss defended the campaign , saying : ' that may be but we are a fitness brand , our own aspirations are to make the nation healthier and ask each one of us to set our sights higher , to be fitter , to be healthier and actually have an inner and outer confidence within ourselves . ' the tv stars also addressed the company 's blunt responses to twitter complaints , including ' why make your insecurities our problem ' and ' grow up ' . but staveley believes the reaction is justified , saying , ' there is an irrational minority who have decided to interpret it in that way . ' susanna , 44 , retorted : ' do you think everybody who objects to it is irrational ? am i an irrational extremist ? ' defending protein world : richard staveley , head of global marketing , insisted the company 's advert was n't meant to offend and was targeted at health-conscious individuals looking to get fit in time for summer . the company boss revealed protein world has received ' threats on our head office , physical and violent threats ' . he added : ' we had a bomb threat ... that\u2019s been reported to the police . it\u2019s currently being investigated . ' staveley concluded his appearance on the itv show by declaring that it had been a ' fantastic campaign ' for the brand and they wo n't changing their advertising methods in future . the advertising standards authority ( asa ) said it has received 216 complaints about the advert and is ' carefully assessing ' the complaints to ' establish if there are grounds for further action ' . sales of protein powder - which can be priced up to \u00a345 per kilogram tub - are rocketing in the uk , growing from \u00a373m in 2007 to \u00a3170m in 2012 . they are expected to reach \u00a3358m by 2017 , according to the market-analyst euromonitor , as gym-going brits add the stuff to post-workout smoothies and drinks in a bid to build muscle . meanwhile , katie hopkins came to protein world 's defence , tweeting : ' chubsters , quit vandalising protein world ads and get your arse running on the road . feminism isn\u2019t an excuse for being fat . eat less , move more .

        "document": "( cnn ) thinking about presidential candidates ?\napparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider .\naccording to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war .\nwhen george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ?\nas cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : \" we 're built differently , we have different hormones .\nin the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that .\ni do n't support a woman being president . \"\n\" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , \" rios wrote in a facebook post .\nif rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president .\nthroughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making .\nstudies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts .\nif science does n't convince you , just google \" cheating politicians \" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them .\nrios has taken a lot of flak for her \" biblically \" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern .\ntime magazine declared hillary clinton the \" perfect \" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is \" biologically primed \" to lead .\n( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . )\nbelieve me , i wish i were .\nno wonder jon stewart left \" the daily show \" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing .\nif discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed .\nbut underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias .\nwe want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything .\nand you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force .\nbut what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed .\nunfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique .\nsome people believe women have \" our place \" and that place is not at the table .\nthey 'll tell your daughter to \" go for it \" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams .\nin a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes .\nthe evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless .\nit 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether .\nthe bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as \" geniuses \" and the women as \" nice . \"\nthe bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it .\nhillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb .\nthat 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone .\nthe fact is , equality benefits everyone .\nit 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) .\nit 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful .\nit 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages .\nand it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results .\nour nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men .\nit 's not enough to say to our daughters : \" you can be anything you want to be . \"\nwhat we need to say is : \" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . \"\nrios said that if clinton is elected , she is \" moving to canada \" because \" a female should n't be president . \"\napparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 2024 .\ncorrection : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .",

'\nlaura agreed with mum sue , 48 , to go on a ` sensible diet ' but soon the whitley bay high school pupil became frustrated , wanting to lose more weight , quicker .\naccording to the nhs anorexia or anorexia nervosa , to give its full name , is a serious mental health condition in which people try to keep their body weight as low as possible .\nit is often said that people will often restrict their intake of food , make themselves vomit or increase the amount of exercise they are doing .\nthe condition often develops in people who are anxious about their body shape or weight , or in those who fear being fat or wish to be thin .\nanorexia most commonly occurs in women , starting around the age of 16 or 17 .\nalthough there are cases of men suffering from the disease too .\noften people suffering from anorexia will obsessively count calories , take laxatives and repeatedly weight themselves or check their bodies in the mirror .\nif you think you know someone who is suffering from the disease talk to them gently about it .\noften it can be hard for them to seek help .\nyou can also seek advice from an eating disorder charity such as beat , who will be able to talk you through how to help them and how to handle the situation .\nin february 2015 it was estimated that around 725,000 people were suffering from an eating disorder in the uk - 10 per cent of those were suffering from anorexia .\n` it was coming off quite slowly , at about 2 lbs a week , ' said laura .\n` but i became much more obsessive about it and decided to reduce my calorie intake .\n` in the end , i was virtually eating nothing , maybe an apple or orange a day .\n` i could tell my parents were getting worried , they could n't understand why i did n't want to eat . '\nlack of food soon took its toll on laura 's health and her heart rate started slowing .\nshe said : ` i was in bed for three or four days , never going out of the house .\n` i would feel dizzy or pass out because my heart rate was so slow .

'\nhe said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people , including lawmakers , uncomfortable .\nbut he thinks the exchange program should n't be viewed as anti-drug policy , but as ` a proven and effective harm-reduction policy . '\n` we simply ca n't afford to view this as a short-term problem , ' clere said .\nmoney could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options .\nsince 1989 , the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs .\npence 's executive order did n't include money for the scott county program .\n` they asked the state agencies to find their own money .\nhow sustainable is that ? '\nsaid dr. beth meyerson , co-director of the rural center for aids/std prevention at indiana university .\n` there 's no evidence that the pence administration is thinking about this in the long term at all .

'\nafter spending a week on a heart monitor at north tyneside general hospital , laura was finally offered support from eating disorder organisations as she began her recovery .\nproblems started for the teen two years ago when she decided she wanted to go on a diet .\n` i was nearly 13 stone and felt like i was too big , ' laura said .\n` i 'd been bullied a little bit because of my weight , people saying things like ` here comes the whale ' and that made me feel horrible .\nlaura was living off just one piece of fruit a day and would hide her food down the side of her bed so her parents would n't see it\nlaura continued : ` i would look around at the other girls and they all seemed to be skinny and , of course , i wanted to be like them and fit into all the different types of clothes .\n` but it was n't just people i knew .\ni felt there was a lot of pressures from all over the place .\neverywhere you looked there seemed to be this idea that girls should be a size zero . '\nlaura agreed with mum sue , 48 , to go on a ` sensible diet ' but soon the whitley bay high school pupil became frustrated , wanting to lose more weight , quicker .\naccording to the nhs anorexia or anorexia nervosa , to give its full name , is a serious mental health condition in which people try to keep their body weight as low as possible .\nit is often said that people will often restrict their intake of food , make themselves vomit or increase the amount of exercise they are doing .\nthe condition often develops in people who are anxious about their body shape or weight , or in those who fear being fat or wish to be thin .\nanorexia most commonly occurs in women , starting around the age of 16 or 17 .\nalthough there are cases of men suffering from the disease too .\noften people suffering from anorexia will obsessively count calories , take laxatives and repeatedly weight themselves or check their bodies in the mirror .\nif you think you know someone who is suffering from the disease talk to them gently about it .\noften it can be hard for them to seek help .\nyou can also seek advice from an eating disorder charity such as beat , who will be able to talk you through how to help them and how to handle the situation .\nin february 2015 it was estimated that around 725,000 people were suffering from an eating disorder in the uk - 10 per cent of those were suffering from anorexia .\n` it was coming off quite slowly , at about 2 lbs a week , ' said laura .\n` but i became much more obsessive about it and decided to reduce my calorie intake .\n` in the end , i was virtually eating nothing , maybe an apple or orange a day .\n` i could tell my parents were getting worried , they could n't understand why i did n't want to eat . '\nlack of food soon took its toll on laura 's health and her heart rate started slowing .\nshe said : ` i was in bed for three or four days , never going out of the house .\n` i would feel dizzy or pass out because my heart rate was so slow . '\nfinally after a week of eating virtually nothing , laura collapsed .\nno happy and healthy laura has made it to the semi final of miss teen gb , the competition aims to stay away from size zero stereotypes\nsue , who works in sales , said : ` an ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital and put on the heart monitor for a week .\nher body had just started to shut down .\n` it was frightening , i was shocked that this was happening to my daughter .\n` i remember sitting by her hospital bed and saying \" laura , do you realise how sick you are ? \"\nbut she just said \" i do n't care , as long as i 'm skinny \" .\n` it was then i realised just how much pressure she , and all girls , were under to look a certain way . '\nafter getting discharged laura began working with eating disorder teams ( edict ) and child and adolescent mental health services ( camhs ) to help in her recovery .\ntoday , her body image is better than ever and her new-found confidence has allowed her to make it through to the semi final of miss teen gb .\nthe contest aims to promote ` positive and confidence-building experiences ' for young girls , away from size zero stereotypes .",

'\nafter spending a week on a heart monitor at north tyneside general hospital , laura was finally offered support from eating disorder organisations as she began her recovery .\nproblems started for the teen two years ago when she decided she wanted to go on a diet .\n` i was nearly 13 stone and felt like i was too big , ' laura said .\n` i 'd been bullied a little bit because of my weight , people saying things like ` here comes the whale ' and that made me feel horrible .\nlaura was living off just one piece of fruit a day and would hide her food down the side of her bed so her parents would n't see it\nlaura continued : ` i would look around at the other girls and they all seemed to be skinny and , of course , i wanted to be like them and fit into all the different types of clothes .\n` but it was n't just people i knew .\ni felt there was a lot of pressures from all over the place .\neverywhere you looked there seemed to be this idea that girls should be a size zero . '\nlaura agreed with mum sue , 48 , to go on a ` sensible diet ' but soon the whitley bay high school pupil became frustrated , wanting to lose more weight , quicker .\naccording to the nhs anorexia or anorexia nervosa , to give its full name , is a serious mental health condition in which people try to keep their body weight as low as possible .\nit is often said that people will often restrict their intake of food , make themselves vomit or increase the amount of exercise they are doing .\nthe condition often develops in people who are anxious about their body shape or weight , or in those who fear being fat or wish to be thin .\nanorexia most commonly occurs in women , starting around the age of 16 or 17 .\nalthough there are cases of men suffering from the disease too .\noften people suffering from anorexia will obsessively count calories , take laxatives and repeatedly weight themselves or check their bodies in the mirror .\nif you think you know someone who is suffering from the disease talk to them gently about it .\noften it can be hard for them to seek help .\nyou can also seek advice from an eating disorder charity such as beat , who will be able to talk you through how to help them and how to handle the situation .\nin february 2015 it was estimated that around 725,000 people were suffering from an eating disorder in the uk - 10 per cent of those were suffering from anorexia .\n` it was coming off quite slowly , at about 2 lbs a week , ' said laura .\n` but i became much more obsessive about it and decided to reduce my calorie intake .\n` in the end , i was virtually eating nothing , maybe an apple or orange a day .\n` i could tell my parents were getting worried , they could n't understand why i did n't want to eat . '\nlack of food soon took its toll on laura 's health and her heart rate started slowing .\nshe said : ` i was in bed for three or four days , never going out of the house .\n` i would feel dizzy or pass out because my heart rate was so slow . '\nfinally after a week of eating virtually nothing , laura collapsed .\nno happy and healthy laura has made it to the semi final of miss teen gb , the competition aims to stay away from size zero stereotypes\nsue , who works in sales , said : ` an ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital and put on the heart monitor for a week .\nher body had just started to shut down .\n` it was frightening , i was shocked that this was happening to my daughter .\n` i remember sitting by her hospital bed and saying \" laura , do you realise how sick you are ? \"\nbut she just said \" i do n't care , as long as i 'm skinny \" .\n` it was then i realised just how much pressure she , and all girls , were under to look a certain way . '\nafter getting discharged laura began working with eating disorder teams ( edict ) and child and adolescent mental health services ( camhs ) to help in her recovery .\ntoday , her body image is better than ever and her new-found confidence has allowed her to make it through to the semi final of miss teen gb .\nthe contest aims to promote ` positive and confidence-building experiences ' for young girls , away from size zero stereotypes .",

' ' i am scared to death . i do n't sleep anymore . ' i 'm only thinking about what happens if they come for me . ' the united states government has sentenced me to death . ' information provided by toro aided in the prosecution of ex-panamanian dictator manuel noriega ( seen 1990 ) .  his fears sound reasonable considering his work aided in the prosecution of cocaine overlord carlos lehder and former panamanian dictator manuel noriega . dea agent mike mcmanus , who was toro 's handler for two years , gained notoriety after working with the uniquely-suited operative . mcmanus who arrested george jung - the drug dealer portrayed by johnny depp in 2001 's blow - gave toro $ 5,000 for an operation after the dea declined to help , the huffington post reported . he said : ' it is government bureaucracy at its worst . ' he deserves to live life ever after in the united states . he 's done his debt , he 's paid his dues , he 's done his service . ' one of toro 's former colleagues recently gave him $ 5,000 for an operation after the dea declined to help . toro remains in limbo while trying to get a green card or a passport , and he ca n't collect social security benefits until he secures one of those documents . his final temporary visa expired on january 1 and toro is prepared to go into hiding if he must . he said : ' i messed up , in a big way , many years ago . ' but i atoned . ' many times over , i atoned . ' all i want now is what they promised me . '  ",

' but it is backtracking after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like microsoft , verizon and ebay complained last month . vox populi began accepting registrations using '.sucks ' on march 30 from trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants . taylor swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn ' and '.adult ' domains . it has recommended charging $ 2,499 a year for the privilege , and according to vox populi ceo john berard , most of the names have been sold by resellers for around $ 2,000 a year . berard has said the domain name is meant to create destinations for companies to interact with their critics and called his company 's business ' well within the lines of icann rules and the law . ' two weeks ago , the advisory body called the intellectual property constituency representing major companies and industry groups asked icann in a letter to halt the rollout of '.sucks , ' calling it a ' shakedown scheme ' and ' predatory .

        "document": "a mother of a baby boy was arrested 27 years after his body was found wrapped in a blanket inside a sainsbury 's bag floating on a village pond . police exhumed the boy 's body from his grave in norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review . a dna sample eventually led them to his mother . the woman , who has not been named , was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends . she explained how she had placed her dead baby in the pond in the village of weasenham st peter on june 5 , 1988 , just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a sunday afternoon outing . scroll down for video . unsolved case : a police officer searches windmill pit , the norfolk pond where the baby boy 's body was found back in 1988 . the boy 's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review , with dna samples leading police to the boy 's mother . he has now been reburied at weasenham st peter church , norfolk . police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the cps decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial . during the original investigation , police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby 's burial at 13th century st peter 's church in the village . a report in the eastern daily press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond . but after the body was exhumed in april last year , dna taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents . detectives examined that person 's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy 's mother . a police spokesman said : ' in this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation . ' thanks to advances in dna we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself . ' sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play . ' det insp andy guy , of norfolk police who led the investigation said the dna was compared to five million samples on the national database . he said : ' it came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age . ' we went to see that individual and she told us she was mum . she was arrested on suspicion of infanticide . ' we were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her . ' the pregnancy was concealed from everybody . she did n't tell her family , her close friends , she gave birth in secret . the baby was stillborn . ' the woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond , known locally as windmill pit , before it was found by a group of teenagers . the boy was originally buried without a name but a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as peter after the name of the church . a second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play . an inquest held in 1988 body also failed to establish a cause of death . the baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on june 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named peter after the name of the church . det insp guy said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time . he added : ' this has been unsolved for 27 years . by using the latest techniques , we 've solved something which has been a mystery for a long time . ' ' we do n't ever give up . all the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they 're reviewed at regular intervals . ' det insp guy said the small team of officers involved in the case had ' mixed feelings ' after bringing the investigation to a final close . he said : ' from a police officer 's perspective , it 's fantastic . from a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her . ' the grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross , which read : ' in loving memory of unknown baby boy . born and died 1988 . ' a support group called hana 's gift for families who have suffered a stillbirth has now paid for a new headstone giving his name as peter . the inscription reads : ' in loving memory of baby peter , june 1988 . a sweet little child , lost but then found , to bloom and grow in heaven 's playground . there is no foot so small that it can not leave an imprint on the world . ' tranquil : the pond in the village of weasenham st peter , norfolk , as it is today . karen murray-tye who set up hana 's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006 , said : ' it was quite hard to find the right words , but i thought the ' lost but found ' fitted the circumstances . ' i hope she sees we 've tried to do the best for him as we have for hana . it would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward . ' norfolk coroner 's chaplain chris copsey said : ' when the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said ' unnamed baby boy ' . ' it seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so i took the name of the church , st peter 's church . '  sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .",

' the latest judgement agrees that kristopher is entitled to a settlement to provide specialist rehabilitation and care which will help maximise his progress . ' mr hicks , who was 23 at the time of the incident , had gotten into the taxi with his girlfriend abigail noad at orange grove taxi rank in bath to his home in the foxhill area , according to high court documents . in a police interview , mr young said he had become suspicious after hearing ms noad joke that the couple were not going to ' do a runner ' . deciding the issue of liability , the judge said mr young mistakenly decided mr hicks was not going to pay the fare on november 2 in 2010 , adding there was no basis for him to think so . the driver had decided to take mr hicks back to the rank to cause him as much inconvenience as possible . mr hicks , who found himself being unlawfully driven off by a stranger into the night , decided he should try to escape . mr justice edis said : ' the end result is that the claimant decided to jump out of the taxi at a dangerous speed . i do not know why he did this . ' it may have been that he misjudged the speed and thought it was safe to do so , but the true motive will never be known . ' he said had mr hicks jumped out when it was stationary at lights there would be no permanent damage . mr hicks had gotten into the taxi at the orange grove rank in bath ( pictured ) in 2010 with his girlfriend . ' i have broadly accepted the evidence of the defendant and therefore find that his intention was not to do anything other than to return him to the rank where he would be released , ' he added . ' this is the kind of conduct which creates a significant risk to life and limb as this case demonstrates . ' the judge said it was a ' stark and unattractive choice ' to decide between the two - and concluded there should be a 50 per cent reduction in the damages payable to mr hicks . he was also entitled to a further \u00a3250 for unlawful imprisonment . lawyers representing mr hicks said the incident left him with ' devastating ' brain injuries and he is now being cared for by his mother gill . speaking at the time the claim was lodged with the high court , james davies , said : ' whilst he has undergone extensive treatment and rehabilitation , he has developed post-traumatic epilepsy , headaches , fatigue , suffers social and behavioural problems and has no sense of taste or smell . ' he is reliant on 24-hour care from his mum and is unable to work . ' both sides were given permission to appeal and a further hearing will determine the amount which mr young will have to pay . ",

should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war .\nwhen george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ?\nas cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : \" we 're built differently , we have different hormones .\nin the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that .\ni do n't support a woman being president . \"\n\" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , \" rios wrote in a facebook post .\nif rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president .\nthroughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making .\nstudies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts .\nif science does n't convince you , just google \" cheating politicians \" for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them .\nrios has taken a lot of flak for her \" biblically \" inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern .\ntime magazine declared hillary clinton the \" perfect \" age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is \" biologically primed \" to lead .\n( she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . )\nbelieve me , i wish i were .\nno wonder jon stewart left \" the daily show \" before the election cycle ramps up in full swing .\nif discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed .\nbut underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias .\nwe want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything .\nand you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force .\nbut what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed .\nunfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique .\nsome people believe women have \" our place \" and that place is not at the table .\nthey 'll tell your daughter to \" go for it \" but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams .\nin a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes .\nthe evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless .\nit 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether .\nthe bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as \" geniuses \" and the women as \" nice . \"\nthe bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it .\nhillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb .\nthat 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone .\nthe fact is , equality benefits everyone .\nit 's better for the bottom line ( companies with more women in leadership roles make more money ) .\nit 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful .\nit 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages .\nand it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results .\nour nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men .\nit 's not enough to say to our daughters : \" you can be anything you want to be . \"\nwhat we need to say is : \" you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . \"\nrios said that if clinton is elected , she is \" moving to canada \" because \" a female should n't be president . \"\napparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 2023 .\ncorrection : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .",

'\nkelly 's brother , ron prouty jr , told robarge ( above ) he hoped he ` rotted in hell ' during the sentencing on friday\nduring his murder trial , he testified that he had not killed his wife , but a new hampshire jury convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days .\nafter the verdict was handed down last month , robarge 's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief .\naccording to police , kelly had filed for divorce after 24 years of marriage on june 27 , 2013 -- the day she disappeared from her charlestown , new hampshire , home and her body was later found .\nthe jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed ` extreme indifference to the value of human life . '\nprosecutors said the entryway to kelly robarge 's home contained ` countless ' spatters of blood .\nfamily members of kelly react in court on february 11 to the not guilty verdicts on charges of first - and second-degree murder before the announcement of a guilty verdict for the charge of second-degree murder for reckless conduct against robarge\nand james robarge 's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it .\nhowever , most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence .\nthe closest thing to an eyewitness was a unity man who said he saw robarge , wearing latex gloves , crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in unity the night kelly disappeared .\nher body was found off a logging road not far from there , and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched robarge 's shattered oil pan .\ndue to the condition of her body , a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of ` homicidal violence . '\nrobarge ( pictured in court in january ) has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years\nmeanwhile , one of the last people to see kelly alive the day she disappeared was frances uptegrove , a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years .\nuptegrove testified that kelly robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce .\nhe said : ` she seemed clear-headed , determined .\nshe 'd made up her mind . '\nin testimony spanning two days , robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced .\nrobarge claimed that he did n't know his wife had filed for divorce , but he acknowledged that just days before , he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one .",
