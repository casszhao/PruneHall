        "document": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders. Reports have suggested an effect of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine in anxiety disorders. Given these considerations, we conducted a controlled trial of quetiapine monotherapy in SAD. Fifteen patients were randomized to quetiapine (up to 400 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. The Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS) and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (CGI-I) were the primary outcome measures, while the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) and the Sheehan Disability Inventory (SDI) were secondary measures. There was no significant difference on the BSPS score at endpoint between the quetiapine and placebo groups. There was a significant time effect but not a significant time x treatment group interaction, indicating that both the quetiapine and placebo patients did better over the course of the trial. 20% of the quetiapine patients had a 50% or greater drop in BSPS score at the end of the trial compared to baseline, while 0% had such a drop in the placebo group. There was no significant difference in responders (CGI-I score of 1 or 2) versus non-responder (CGI-I score of 3 or more) across the groups. However, 40% of quetiapine patients and 0% of the placebo patients showed much or very much improvement on the CGI-I. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) to be a responder on the CGI-I was 3. Significant time effects were noted for the SPIN and SDI, as well as a significant time x treatment effect in favor of quetiapine on the SPIN. Additionally, quetiapine showed a large effect size on the SPIN.",

        "title": "Remote ischemic preconditioning reduces myocardial and renal injury after elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: a randomized controlled trial.",
        "document": "Myocardial and renal injury commonly contribute to perioperative morbidity and mortality after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomenon whereby brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion in one organ provide systemic protection from prolonged ischemia. To investigate whether remote preconditioning reduces the incidence of myocardial and renal injury in patients undergoing elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, we performed a randomized trial. METHOD AND RESULTS; Eighty-two patients were randomized to abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with RIPC or conventional abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (control). Two cycles of intermittent crossclamping of the common iliac artery with 10 minutes ischemia followed by 10 minutes reperfusion served as the RIPC stimulus. Myocardial injury was assessed by cardiac troponin I (>0.40 ng/mL), myocardial infarction by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association definition and renal injury by serum creatinine (>177 micromol/L) according to American Heart Association guidelines for risk stratification in major vascular surgery. The groups were well matched for baseline characteristics. RIPC reduced the incidence of myocardial injury by 27% (39% versus 12% [95% CI: 8.8% to 45%]; P=0.005), myocardial infarction by 22% (27% versus 5% [95% CI: 7.3% to 38%]; P=0.006), and renal impairment by 23% (30% versus 7%; [95% CI: 6.4 to 39]; P=0.009). Multivariable analysis revealed the protective effect of RIPC on myocardial injury (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.67; P=0.008), myocardial infarction (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.75; P=0.006) and renal impairment were independent of other covariables.\n                In patients undergoing elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, RIPC reduces the incidence of postoperative myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, and renal impairment.",

In a 12-month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 812 adults (mean age 64 yrs, mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 36% predicted normal), patients received two inhalations twice daily of either budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort) 160/4.5 microg (delivered dose), budesonide 200 microg (metered dose), formoterol 4.5 microg or placebo. Severe exacerbations and FEV1 (primary variables), peak expiratory flow (PEF), COPD symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQL), mild exacerbations, use of reliever beta2-agonist and safety variables were recorded. Budesonide/formoterol reduced the mean number of severe exacerbations per patient per year by 24% versus placebo and 23% versus formoterol. FEV1 increased by 15% versus placebo and 9% versus budesonide. Morning PEF improved significantly on day 1 versus placebo and budesonide; after 1 week, morning PEF was improved versus placebo, budesonide and formoterol. Improvements in morning and evening PEF versus comparators were maintained over 12 months. Budesonide/formoterol decreased all symptom scores and use of reliever beta2-agonists significantly versus placebo and budesonide, and improved HRQL versus placebo. All treatments were well tolerated. These results suggest a role for budesonide/formoterol in the long-term management of moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

The hostel ward residents also develop superior domestic skills, use more facilities in the community, and are more likely to be engaged in constructive activities than controls.

In the present study, the possible interactions of the ACE-inhibitor perindopril with several of the most common long-term diseases was evaluated.\n                In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the effect of perindopril was evaluated in 490 patients with mild essential hypertension and any one of the following concomitant diseases: hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, nephropathy with proteinuria, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or degenerative joint disease treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). After a 3-week single-blind placebo run-in, the patients received either perindopril (4 mg/d) or matching placebo for 6 weeks.\n                Blood pressure was effectively reduced by perindopril irrespective of the associated disease. The rate of spontaneously reported side effects was low. Treatment with perindopril was free from adverse interactions with the concomitant diseases and therapies. Moreover, favorable actions could be observed in patients with ischemic heart disease (reduction of maximal ST-segment depression during peak exercise and decrease in the number of angina attacks), in patients with proteinuria (decrease in albuminuria in patients with normal serum creatinine levels), and in patients with NSAID-treatment (increase in prostaglandin E2 concentration in gastric mucosa suggesting gastric cytoprotection).\n                This trial shows that ACE-inhibition with perindopril represents a simple, safe, and effective short-term therapeutic option for the large proportion of patients with mild essential hypertension and concomitant diseases and therapies.",

        "document": "Depression and hostility are significant risk factors for mortality and morbidity after myocardial infarction (MI). Much research is still needed to identify effective ways to reduce emotional distress in patients with cardiovascular disease. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the efficacy and safety of the antidepressant fluoxetine in patients with depression after their first MI.\n                Fifty-four patients with major depression after MI were randomly assigned to receive a flexible-dose regimen of fluoxetine or placebo for the first 9 weeks of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients without serious adverse effects who wished to continue participating in the study were given fluoxetine or placebo for an additional 16 weeks. To evaluate the efficacy of fluoxetine, the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the Hostility Scale of the 90-item Symptom Check List (SCL-90) were used as primary measures of outcome. To evaluate the safety of fluoxetine, cardiac function was measured before and after treatment with echocardiography and electrocardiography.\n                The a priori difference in antidepressive efficacy (4-point difference in HAMD-17 scores between the fluoxetine and placebo groups) was not met. However, the response rate among patients receiving fluoxetine was significantly greater than that among patients receiving placebo at week 25 (48 vs. 26%, p = .05). Among patients with mild depression (HAMD-17 score < or =21), HAMD-17 scores were significantly different (p < .05) between the fluoxetine and placebo groups at weeks 9 (by 5.4 points) and 25 (by 5.8 points). Also, hostility scores at week 25 were significantly reduced among patients receiving fluoxetine (p = .02). Analysis of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters revealed no decrease in cardiac function as a result of treatment with fluoxetine. Conclusions: Although the overall difference between the fluoxetine and placebo groups was not significant, there was a trend favoring fluoxetine in this relatively small sample. The response rate in the group receiving fluoxetine was comparable with that observed in other studies of patients with cardiovascular disease. In addition, fluoxetine seemed to be particularly effective in patients with mild depression and was associated with a statistically significant reduction in hostility. The results of this study suggest that fluoxetine can be safely used to treat patients with post-MI depression beginning 3 months after the event.",

        "document": "Facial skin treatments with laser resurfacing, dermabrasion, and chemical peels were responsible for a significant portion of the 2.7 million cosmetic procedures performed in 1998. Perioral wrinkles are a common problem for which plastic surgical consultation is obtained. The aim of this study was to compare and quantify the advantages and disadvantages of laser resurfacing versus dermabrasion in the treatment of perioral wrinkles. Twenty female patients provided informed consent and participated in the study. Half of the perioral area was treated with dermabrasion and half was treated with the UltraPulse CO2 laser. The two procedures were compared using high-quality photographs; a biophysical evaluation of skin color, hydration, and mechanical properties; and patient evaluation of outcomes. Photographs were evaluated by 10 board-certified plastic surgeons who were blinded to the treatment methods. The laser treatment had a significantly higher erythema score at 1 month and a small but significantly greater improvement in perioral wrinkles at 6 months. Thirteen subjects selected the laser treatment as producing the best result, despite the greater intraoperative pain for this procedure. Biomechanical measurements suggest that the laser treatment produced a skin state more similar to skin in younger patients, presumably with higher levels and/or greater organization of the collagen and elastin. Patient preference was inferred from the resurfacing method that they would recommend to a friend. Although the laser was selected as the best result in a majority of cases, patient preference was equally distributed between the two treatments. The authors think that by studying and quantifying the biophysical changes that occur as a result of CO2 laser resurfacing, greater improvements in restoring actinic damage (e.g., wrinkles) can be achieved. Patients consider more than the objective skin changes from a resurfacing technique when making a recommendation to a friend.",

Serial measurements of serum cardiac troponin T were obtained in 76 of 101 patients in the doxorubicin group and 82 of 105 patients in the group given dexrazoxane and doxorubicin. A total of 2377 serum samples (mean, 15.1 samples per patient) were obtained before, during, and after treatment with doxorubicin.

        "document": "To demonstrate that in patients receiving naproxen for the pain of osteoarthritis (OA), the addition of tramadol will allow a reduction in the naproxen dosage without compromising pain relief.\n                This trial consisted of a 5-week open-label run-in and an 8-week double-blind phase. Patients with at least moderate pain (> or =40 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale) of OA of the knee after a 1-week medication washout were treated with naproxen 500 mg/day for 1 week. Patients whose pain scores were reduced to <20 mm were discontinued. The remaining patients received naproxen 1,000 mg/day for 3 weeks. Tramadol 200 mg/day was added during the third week. Patients were then randomized in a double-blind manner to continue tramadol 200 mg/day or to begin placebo in addition to naproxen. Randomization was stratified based on response to naproxen 1,000 mg/day. During the double-blind phase, the naproxen dose was reduced by 250 mg every 2 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the minimum effective naproxen dose (MEND). The MEND was defined as 250 mg above the naproxen daily dosage at which pain relief was no longer adequate. Patients discontinuing the double-blind phase of the study for reasons other than lack of efficacy were assigned a MEND equal to the last naproxen dose received. If the effect of treatment between the responder and nonresponder groups was statistically different, the difference in the MEND was assessed separately within the groups.\n                Of 236 patients randomized (mean age 61 years; 147 females), 90 were stratified as naproxen responders and 146 as naproxen nonresponders. There was a significant difference (P = 0.040) in the treatment effect between the naproxen responders and nonresponders, thus demonstrating a difference in the way responders and nonresponders react to a decrease in naproxen dosage after the addition of tramadol. Among naproxen responders, the MEND was significantly lower in patients receiving tramadol (n = 36) than in patients receiving placebo (n = 54), 221 mg versus 407 mg, respectively (P = 0.021). For the naproxen nonresponders, the mean MEND was 419 mg in the tramadol group and 396 mg in the placebo group (P = 0.706).\n                In patients with painful OA of the knee responding to naproxen 1,000 mg/day, the addition of tramadol 200 mg/day allows a significant reduction in the dosage of naproxen without compromising pain relief.",

        "document": "The treatment of patients allergic to insect stings with insect-venom injections has been shown to be 97 percent effective in reducing the risk of sting-induced anaphylaxis. However, the frequency of systemic reactions to subsequent stings in unimmunized adults with previous reactions is approximately 60 percent. To determine which factors, in addition to a history of reaction and evidence of venom-specific IgE antibody, predispose patients to future insect-sting reactions, we studied a venom-sensitive group of children who were deemed to be at relatively low risk for severe reactions; 28 percent of them received venom therapy.\n                We studied 242 children, 2 through 16 years of age, each of whom had had a systemic allergic reaction, affecting only the skin, to an insect sting. Each child had a positive skin-test reaction to one or more of five hymenopteran venoms. Sixty-eight children received immunotherapy with insect venom and 174 did not; about half were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and the rest were assigned on the basis of the patient's (or the parents') choice. The results of accidental stings during four years of observation were evaluated.\n                In the treated group, 84 stings in 36 patients resulted in one systemic reaction (1.2 percent of stings). In contrast, 196 stings in 86 untreated children resulted in 18 systemic reactions (9.2 percent of stings, P less than 0.001). Sixteen of these 18 reactions were judged to be milder than the patient's reaction to the first sting, 2 were similar in severity, and none were more severe.\n                These data confirm that immunotherapy with insect venom prevents recurrences of systemic reactions after subsequent insect stings. Because of the surprisingly low rate of reactions among untreated children, we could not identify any characteristics that were predictive of repeat reactions. Since only 9.2 percent of stings in the untreated children led to a systemic reaction and since there was no progression to a more severe reaction, we conclude that venom immunotherapy is unnecessary for most children who are allergic to insect stings.",

However, it is still unknown whether vasopressin and terlipressin are equally effective for hemodynamic support in septic shock. The aim of the present prospective, randomized, controlled pilot trial study was, therefore, to compare the impact of continuous infusions of either vasopressin or terlipressin, when given as first-line therapy in septic shock patients, on open-label norepinephrine requirements.\n                We enrolled septic shock patients (n = 45) with a mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation. Patients were randomized to receive continuous infusions of either terlipressin (1.3 microg.kg-1.h-1), vasopressin (.03 U.min-1) or norepinephrine (15 microg.min-1; n = 15 per group). In all groups, open-label norepinephrine was added to achieve a mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg, if necessary. Data from right heart and thermo-dye dilution catheterization, gastric tonometry, as well as laboratory variables of organ function were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after randomization. Differences within and between groups were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements with group and time as factors. Time-independent variables were compared with one-way ANOVA.\n                There were no differences among groups in terms of systemic and regional hemodynamics. Compared with infusion of .03 U of vasopressin or 15 microg.min-1 of norepinephrine, 1.3 microg.kg-1.h-1 of terlipressin allowed a marked reduction in catecholamine requirements (0.8 +/- 1.3 and 1.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 0.2 +/- 0.4 microg.kg-1.min-1 at 48 hours; each P < 0.05) and was associated with less rebound hypotension (P < 0.05). At the end of the 48-hour intervention period, bilirubin concentrations were higher in the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups as compared with the terlipressin group (2.3 +/- 2.8 and 2.8 +/- 2.5 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.3 mg.dL-1; each P < 0.05). A time-dependent decrease in platelet count was only observed in the terlipressin group (P < 0.001 48 hours vs. BL).\n                The present study provides evidence that continuous infusion of low-dose terlipressin--when given as first-line vasopressor agent in septic shock--is effective in reversing sepsis-induced arterial hypotension and in reducing norepinephrine requirements.",

        "document": "Following extensive phase II trials of the combination of dacarbazine and interferon-alpha 2a we performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of this combination versus dacarbazine alone as systemic therapy for symptomatic, measurable metastatic malignant melanoma. The two treatment arms were well matched for age, sex, performance, status, relapse-free survival, prior therapy and sites of disease. Therapy consisted of dacarbazine given in combination in escalating doses of 200 mg/m2, 400 mg/m2 and 800 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks, or alone at 800 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks. Interferon was administered subcutaneously starting at 3 mU daily on days 1-3, 9 mU daily on days 4-70, then 9 mU three times per week. Therapy was continued for at least 6 months unless overt progressive disease was observed. Eighty seven patients were randomized to the combination and 83 patients to dacarbazine alone. Response rates were respectively, complete 7% and 2%, and partial 14% and 15%, for a total response rate of 21% (95% confidence limits 13-31%) and 17% (95% confidence limits 10-27%). Median duration of response was 258 and 286 days, and survival of the whole groups 229 and 269 days respectively. Toxicity was worse in the combination arm, with more patients experiencing fatigue, nausea and anorexia, flu-like symptoms and neutropenia. However quality of life was not significantly different in either group, except that fatigue, as measured at week 12 by LASA scales, and activity, as measured by the functional living index, were both improved in the combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The effect of two doses of inhaled salbutamol (0.15 mg.kg-1 x 2; 30 min apart) (n = 87) was compared with that of one dose of salbutamol given intravenously (5 micrograms.kg-1) (n = 89). There was a significantly larger increase in peak expiratory flow after the first inhaled dose in the group that received inhalation treatment than in the i.v. treated group (69 vs 41 l.min-1, p less than 0.05), but there was no difference in systemic side-effects between the groups. After the second inhaled dose there was a further increase in PEF, but also in systemic side-effects. These treatments were also compared in a cross-over study on 18 of the patients who returned with a second attack of severe acute asthma. The cross-over evaluation produced similar results, with a significantly larger increase in PEF after the first inhaled dose than after the i.v. treatment. Fifteen of the 18 patients found the inhalations more effective than the i.v. treatment. Theophylline (3-6 mg.kg-1) was infused i.v. 60 min after the start of salbutamol treatment, and a significant increase in PEF was observed in both groups. A correlation between the increase in PEF and the increase in plasma theophylline concentration was only found in the group that had received i.v. salbutamol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The patients in the PGE1 group received continuous infusion containing 60 microg PGE1 and 100 mg hydrocortisone for 7 days, and the patients in the placebo group were treated with continuous infusion containing an inactive placebo and 100 mg hydrocortisone.\n                No significant differences were observed in the improvements of pure-tone average and subjective symptoms between the PGE1 and the placebo groups. However, the hearing improvement at high frequencies (4 kHz and 8 kHz) was significantly higher in the PGE1 group than in the placebo group, especially in the patients with severe tinnitus.\n                These results failed to prove a beneficial effect of PGE1 in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Further studies will be needed to clarify the pharmacologic actions of PGE1 in the cochlea.",

        "document": "Regular chest physiotherapy is advocated in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis despite little evidence supporting its routine use. This study aimed to establish the efficacy of regular chest physiotherapy in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis compared with no regular chest physiotherapy. 20 patients not practising regular chest physiotherapy were enrolled in a randomised crossover trial of 3 months of twice daily chest physiotherapy using an oscillatory positive expiratory pressure device compared with 3 months of no chest physiotherapy. The primary end-point was the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). Additional outcomes included 24-h sputum volume, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC (FEF(25-75%)), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), exercise capacity, sputum microbiology and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The treatment effect was estimated using the differences of the pairs of observations from each patient. There was a significant improvement in all domains and total LCQ score with regular chest physiotherapy (median (interquartile range) total score improvement 1.3 (-0.17-3.25) units; p = 0.002). 24-h sputum volume increased significantly with regular chest physiotherapy (2 (0-6) mL; p = 0.02), as did exercise capacity (40 (15-80) m; p = 0.001) and SGRQ total score (7.77 (-0.99-14.5) unit improvement; p = 0.004). No significant differences were seen in sputum bacteriology, FEV(1), FVC, FEF(25-75%), MIP or MEP.

        "document": "We wished to determine the short-term safety and efficacy of a Chinese medicinal herb preparation in treating symptoms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in a University-affiliated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinic at a public general hospital. Thirty adults with symptomatic HIV infection, no previous AIDS-defining diagnosis, and CD4+ counts of 0.200-0.499 x 10(9)/L (200-499/mm3) received 28 tablets each day of either a standardized oral preparation of 31 Chinese herbs or a cellulose placebo. Primary outcome measures were changes in life satisfaction, perceived health, and number and severity of symptoms. Other outcomes included adherence, and changes in weight, CD4+ count, depression, anxiety, physical and social function, and mental health. Two placebo- and no herb-treated subjects had mild adverse events (AE). Subjects on both arms reported taking 94% of prescribed tablets. No differences between treatment groups reached the p < 0.05 level. Life satisfaction improved in herb-treated [+0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): +0.29, +1.43] but not in placebo-treated subjects (+0.20, 95% CI -0.35, + 0.75). Number of symptoms was reduced in subjects receiving herbs (-2.2, 95% CI -4.1, -0.3) but not in those receiving placebo (-0.3, 95% CI -3.2, +2.7). There were trends toward greater improvements among herb-treated subjects on all symptom subscales except dermatologic. Believing that one was receiving herbs was strongly associated with reporting that the treatment had helped (p < 0.005), but not with changes in life satisfaction or symptoms. There were improvements in life satisfaction and symptoms among subjects receiving the herbal therapy. Whether Chinese herbs are effective in the management of symptomatic HIV infection can be adequately addressed only by larger trials of longer duration.",

        "document": "It has long been held that the acute-phase and neuroendocrine response to stress requires afferent neural input for its propagation. To further clarify the role of afferent neural impulses in this process and to determine the ability of epidural anesthesia to attenuate the normal perioperative stress response, 39 patients undergoing uncomplicated abdominal aortic replacement were randomized to receive either general anesthesia with postoperative patient-controlled intravenous morphine (n = 19) or combined regional/general anesthesia with intraoperative epidural catheter anesthesia using Bupivacaine to the T4 dermatome level followed by postoperative epidural morphine (n = 20). The stress response was quantitated by blinded measurement of baseline and postoperative (0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours) serum cortisol, epinephrine norepinephrine, total catecholamines, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Total operative time (4.2 +/- 0.3 vs 4.3 +/- 0.4 hours), 72-hour fluid requirement (7.0 +/- 0.6 vs 6.8 +/- 0.71 mL), and length of hospitalization (7.8 +/- 1.4 vs 8.1 +/- 1.2 days) were not different between groups. All patients showed a significant increase in cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, total catecholamines, CRP, and IL-6 in the postoperative period (P < 0.05). IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were less predictable and undetectable in most patients. There was no difference in any of the stress response indices between those patients receiving patient-controlled or epidural catheter anesthesia. In fact, the only parameter that was predictive of increased activation of the stress response was the length of operation, irrespective of anesthetic method. Those patients with operative times greater than 5 hours (n = 10) developed significantly higher CRP, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels (P < 0.05) at 12 and 24 hours postoperatively than those with total operative times less than 4 hours (n = 16). The neuroendocrine response to major surgical stress is propagated normally despite epidural blockade and is intensified with prolonged operative times. The inflammatory cytokines appear to play a major role in this process.",

Fifty-six were subdiagnosed as senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), 56 as multiinfarct dementia (MID), based on computed tomography and Hachinski scores (< or = 49 SDAT, > or = 7 MID). They received, after 2 weeks' run-in period (placebo), randomized for 8 weeks either 2 x 30 mg nicergoline (NIC) or 2 x 1 placebo (PLAC) orally. The four subgroups (SDAT/NIC. SDAT/PLAC, MID/NIC, MID/PLAC; 4 x 28 patients) were comparable in regard to age and sex. Only four, four, four and two patients of the respective groups did not finish the study for minor reasons. Confirmatory statistical analysis demonstrated in the target variable-the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-a significant superiority of Global Impression (CGI)-a significant superiority of NIC over PLAC in both the SDAT and MID groups. Global improvement (CGI item 2) was seen in both nicergoline subgroups (3 and 3), while no changes occurred under placebo (4 and 4, respectively). The responder versus non-responder ratio was in the SDAT/NIC group 16/8, versus 8/16 in the SDAT/PLAC group (chi 2 = 4.1, P = 0.04); in the MID/NIC group 17/7, versus 7/19 in the MID/PLAC group (chi 2 = 7.96, P < 0.005). Furthermore, there was a significant improvement of the Mini-Mental State and the SCAG score in both the MID and SDAT group after 8 weeks of nicergoline, which was significantly superior to the minimal improvement or no change in placebo-treated SDAT and MID patients. EEG mapping demonstrated in NIC-treated SDAT and MID patients a significant decrease in delta and theta, increase in alpha 2 and beta activity and an acceleration of the centroid of the total power spectrum as compared with pretreatment, while opposite changes occurred in PLAC-treated SDAT and MID patients. The differences between PLAC and NIC reached the level of statistical significance. Event-related potential (ERP) recordings demonstrated a significantly shortened P300 latency under NIC treatment in both SDAT and MID patients, while there was a trend towards lengthening under PLAC. Thus, nicergoline improved vigilance and information processing at the neurophysiological level, which leads at the behavioural level to clinical improvement both in degenerative and vascular dementia.",

Eighteen patients in the selective NGD group never required intubation, while 19 did require intubation within a mean of 3 days after surgery. In both groups, tubes remained in place for a mean of 4.7 days. The routine NGD group had a 2.5% incidence of emesis, while the selective NGD group had a 51% incidence of emesis. The return of bowel function, return to a regular diet, and postoperative length of hospital stay were similar in both groups. The patients in the selective NGD group who did not require intubation had a shorter postoperative stay. Fifty-eight percent of patients in the selective NGD group who required intubation had had major vascular or retroperitoneal dissections. These data support selective use of NGD in general surgical patients and routine use of NGD for patients having major retroperitoneal or vascular procedures.",

APA has identified treatment of depression during pregnancy as a priority for clinical guidelines.\n                A 16-week bilingual controlled clinical trial compared a group receiving interpersonal psychotherapy for antepartum depression to a parenting education control program. Fifty outpatient antepartum women who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy or a didactic parenting education program. Thirty-eight women remained in the study and were included in the data analysis. Depressed mood was measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.

In fact, verapamil (VP) was shown to prevent cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced decreases in RBF in mice and in cadaver renal transplant (CRT) recipients. The study presented here of 59 cadaver renal transplant patients evaluates the outcome from perioperative treatment with VP (N = 30) administered intraoperatively into the renal artery (10 mg) followed by oral administration of 120 mg every 8 to 12 h for 14 days versus no drug (N = 29). Early immunosuppression included azathioprine, corticosteroids, and antilymphocyte globulin with subsequent overlapping with CsA on days 5 and 6. Actuarial graft survival at 1 yr was different when the two groups were compared (P less than 0.05). Estimated graft survival at 1 yr for VP patients was 93.3 compared with 72.4% in control patients. The improved graft survival was most striking in repeat transplants with 90% graft survival at 1 yr for VP recipients versus 37.5% for controls. Compared with controls, VP recipients had significantly improved renal parenchymal diastolic blood flow velocities on the first day after surgery (7.8 versus 5.8 cm/s). By day 7, GFR were greater with VP (44 +/- 29 mL/min) versus controls (28 +/- 22 mL/min). Of VP patients, 67% (18 of 24) had GFR greater than 30 mL/min versus 33% (9 of 26) for control patients. Similarly, on the seventh day, 77% (21 of 30) of VP patients had serum creatinines less than 2.0 mg% versus 34% (10 of 29) for controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "document": "To determine the effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist amantadine on levodopa-associated dyskinesias and motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD).\n                NMDA receptor blockade can ameliorate levodopa-induced dyskinesias in primates and PD patients. Amantadine, a well-tolerated and modestly effective antiparkinsonian agent, was recently found to possess NMDA antagonistic properties.\n                Eighteen patients with advanced PD participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. At the end of each 3-week treatment arm, parkinsonian and dyskinesia scores were obtained during a steady-state intravenous levodopa infusion. Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias were also documented with patient-kept diaries and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) interviews.\n                In the 14 patients completing this trial, amantadine reduced dyskinesia severity by 60% (p = 0.001) compared to placebo, without altering the antiparkinsonian effect of levodopa. Motor fluctuations occurring with patients' regular oral levodopa regimen also improved according to UPDRS and patient-kept diaries.\n                These findings suggest that amantadine given as adjuvant to levodopa can markedly improve motor response complications and support the view that hyperfunction of NMDA receptors contributes to the pathogenesis of levodopa-associated motor complications.",

We assessed the effect of oral high-dose methylprednisolone therapy in attacks of MS.\n                Twenty-five patients with an attack of MS lasting less than 4 weeks were randomized to placebo treatment. Twenty-six patients received oral methylprednisolone (500 mg once a day for 5 days with a 10-day tapering period). The patients received scores on the Scripps Neurological Rating Scale (NRS) and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale. The symptoms were scored on a visual analog scale (VAS) before treatment and after 1, 3, and 8 weeks of treatment. Primary efficacy measures were NRS and VAS scores in the first 3 weeks and changes in NRS score and answers to an efficacy questionnaire administered after 8 weeks of treatment.\n                Changes in NRS scores among methylprednisolone- and placebo-treated patients differed significantly in the first 3 weeks and after 8 weeks (p = 0.005 and p = 0.0007). VAS scores the first 3 weeks and treatment efficacy after 8 weeks also favored a beneficial effect of methylprednisolone treatment (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05). After 1, 3, and 8 weeks, 4%, 24%, and 32% in the placebo group and 31%, 54%, and 65% in the methylprednisolone group had improved one point on the Expanded Disability Status Scale score (all p < 0.05). No serious adverse events were seen.\n                Oral high-dose methylprednisolone is recommended for managing attacks of MS.",

        "document": "Acid aspiration syndrome is still an important cause which contributes to maternal mortality in obstetric anesthesia. In this study, we compared famotidine, ranitidine, omeprazole with placebo for prophylaxis against aspiration pneumonitis in elective Cesarean section under regional anesthesia.\n                One hundred and sixty patients undergoing elective Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were allocated randomly into four groups: Group P (n = 40) received placebo only; Group F (n = 40) received famotidine 40 mg Group R (n = 40) received ranitidine 300 mg; and Group O (n = 40) received omeprazole 40 mg. All drugs were given orally at least three hours before the patients entering the operating room. Gastric content was directly aspirated and measured respectively with a flexible fiberoscope under visualization and by a pH meter after delivery.\n                Although these three drugs (F, R, and O) were all effective in controlling the secretion of gastric acid, from gastric analysis it was demonstrated that famotidine and ranitidine could be more defective to neutralize acidity than omeprazole (p < 0.05). Percentages of patients with pH < or = 2.5 in Groups P, F, R, and O were respectively 88%, 10%, 8%, and 21%, showing that the innate pH of gastric juice was far lower than expected. Patients receiving omeprazole in single oral dose regimen retained a greater gastric volume (> or = 0.4 ml/kg) than those who received famotidine or ranitidine (p < 0.005). From the criteria defining the patients \"at risk\" (pH < or = 2.5 and gastric volume > or = 0.4 ml/kg), it is speculated that all these three regimens could potentially reduce the incidence of patients with calculated risk.\n                Our data demonstrated that parturients under regional anesthesia were at a higher risk of aspiration pneumonitis than generally thought. Single dose of ranitidine or famotidine administered orally three hours before surgery provided a more effective means to control and neutralize gastric secretion than omeprazole in parturients.",

A low-glycemic index diet is commonly advised as treatment for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, the efficacy of this advice and associated pregnancy outcomes have not been systematically examined. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prescribing a low-glycemic index diet for women with GDM could reduce the number of women requiring insulin without compromise of pregnancy outcomes.\n                All women with GDM seen over a 12-month period were considered for inclusion in the study. Women (n = 63) were randomly assigned to receive either a low-glycemic index diet or a conventional high-fiber (and higher glycemic index) diet.\n                Of the 31 women randomly assigned to a low-glycemic index diet, 9 (29%) required insulin. Of the women randomly assigned to a higher-glycemic index diet, a significantly higher proportion, 19 of 32 (59%), met the criteria to commence insulin treatment (P = 0.023). However, 9 of these 19 women were able to avoid insulin use by changing to a low-glycemic index diet. Key obstetric and fetal outcomes were not significantly different.\n                Using a low-glycemic index diet for women with GDM effectively halved the number needing to use insulin, with no compromise of obstetric or fetal outcomes.",

Forty-five consecutive patients who attended for fixed appliance therapy were randomly selected. Four hundred twenty-six brackets were bonded (213 with compomer and 213 with resin adhesive) with a split mouth design; the right or left side allocation of compomer in either arch was alternated. Color transparencies of the maxillary incisors, mandibular incisors, or both, and transparencies of the canines, were taken before treatment. At the debond stage, the transparencies were projected (20x) and assessed by an experienced examiner, who used a caries index. The survival time distributions for brackets bonded with each bonding agent were not significantly different (P = .74, paired Prentice-Wilcoxon test; P = .75, Akritas test), with bracket failure rates of 17% and 20% recorded for compomer and resin adhesive, respectively. Neither the patients' sex (P = .85) nor malocclusion (P = .26) appear to affect significantly bracket survival, but patient age was identified as a useful prognostic indicator of bracket survival (P < .001). On average, there was more decalcification related to brackets bonded with resin adhesive than with compomer (P = .0075). Survival time distributions of brackets bonded with compomer or resin adhesive appear comparable, but decalcification was reduced significantly by bonding with compomer.",

In the group given peginterferon and ribavirin, only 14 percent of subjects with HCV genotype 1 infection had a sustained virologic response (7 of 51), as compared with 73 percent of subjects with an HCV genotype other than 1 (11 of 15, P<0.001).

Ninty-five eyes (81.9%) with visual acuity remained or improved after the surgery (P > 0.05). The most frequent complications for long-term follow-up included elevated IOP (IOP > 22 mmHg) (19.8%), the iris adherent to the proximal orifice of the tube (15.5%), developed cataract formation (12.9%) and so on (P > 0.05). We didn't find any severe complications after using MMC.\n                This study suggests that HAD implantation is an effective method in the management of refractory glaucoma in spite of its unneligible complications and combined with MMC can improve the prognosis.",

        "document": "This prospective, controlled study was performed in order to evaluate whether the location of uterine fibroids may influence reproductive function in women and whether removal of the fibroid prior to conception may improve pregnancy rate and pregnancy maintenance. We examined 181 women affected by uterine fibroids who had been trying to conceive for at least 1 year without success. The main outcome measures were the pregnancy rate and the miscarriage rate. Among the patients who underwent myomectomy, the pregnancy rates obtained were 43.3% in cases of submucosal, 56.5% in cases of intramural, 40.0% in cases of submucosal-intramural and 35.5% in cases of intramural-subserosal uterine fibroids, respectively. Among the patients who did not undergo surgical treatment, the pregnancy rates obtained were 27.2% in women with submucosal, 41.0% in women with intramural, 15.0% in women with submucosal-intramural and 21.43% in women with intramural-subserosal uterine fibroids, respectively. Although the results were not statistically significant in the group of women with intramural and intramural-subserosal fibroids, this study confirms the important role of the position of the uterine fibroid in infertility as well as the importance of fibroids removal before the achievement of a pregnancy, to improve both the chances of fertilization and pregnancy maintenance.",

The primary efficacy endpoint was response rate. Responses were assessed using World Health Organization criteria and were required to be of at least 6 weeks' duration. The primary safety endpoint was cardiotoxicity. Cardiac function was monitored by multiple-gated radionuclide cardioangiography scan, and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was scored at a central laboratory. Patients were removed from study if LVEF declined 20 or more EF units from baseline to a final value of greater than or equal to 50%, or by 10 or more units to a final value of less than 50%, or onset of clinical congestive heart failure (CHF).\n                Median age was 54 years in both treatment groups. All relevant prognostic factors were balanced, with the exception that there were significantly more progesterone receptor positive patients in the doxorubicin-treated group. Protocol-defined cardiotoxicity was observed in 13% of TLC D-99 patients (including 2 cases of CHF) compared to 29% of doxorubicin patients (including 9 cases of CHF). Median cumulative doxorubicin dose at onset of cardiotoxicity was 785 mg/m(2) for TLC D-99 versus 570 mg/m(2) for doxorubicin (P = 0.0001; hazard ratio, 3.56). The overall response rate was 26% in both treatment groups. The median TTP was 2.9 months on TLC D-99 versus 3.1 months on doxorubicin. Median survival was 16 versus 20 months with a nonsignificant trend in favor of doxorubicin (P = 0.09). Clinical toxicities, commonly associated with doxorubicin, appeared less common with TLC D-99, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was only one report of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (Grade 2) with this liposomal formulation of doxorubicin.\n                Single-agent TLC D-99 produces less cardiotoxicity than doxorubicin, while providing comparable antitumor activity.\n                Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.",

        "document": "The use of exercises in the treatment of patients with vestibular deficits has become increasingly popular, and evidence exists that these exercises are beneficial in patients with chronic vestibular deficits. The question as to whether patients with acute unilateral vestibular loss would benefit from vestibular adaptation exercises is particularly compelling, however, because animal studies have demonstrated that the acute stage after unilateral vestibular loss is a critical period for recovery. Deprivation of visuomotor experience during that period can delay the onset of recovery as well as prolong the recovery period. Patients often avoid movement during the early stage because, with movement, they experience an increase in dysequilibrium and nausea. We examined the recovery of postural stability in patients during the acute stage after resection of acoustic neuroma to determine whether vestibular adaptation exercises facilitate the onset of recovery and improve the rate of recovery. The results suggest that vestibular adaptation exercises result in improved postural stability and in a diminished perception of dysequilibrium.",

The yield of explanatory x-ray findings was over three times greater among patients with indications for radiography than among those without. Furthermore, an indication for x-rays existed for all patients found to have a malignancy, and for 13 of 14 patients with an identified fracture. Actual physician ordering, however, did not correspond well with the recommended indications. Application of selective criteria appears safe and may improve the yield of useful findings.

Twenty-eight patients with a positive head-up tilt test were randomized to receive either metoprolol or verapamil; the test was repeated after 7 days of therapy. Of the 15 patients initially given metoprolol, 2 (13.3%) did not respond; both were crossed over to verapamil, to which they remained unresponsive. Of the 13 patients who initially received verapamil, 8 (61%) did not respond; after crossing over to metoprolol therapy, 1 remained unresponsive. Overall, 20 of 23 patients receiving metoprolol had negative results on repeat tilt testing, whereas only 5 of 15 patients receiving verapamil had negative results (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that verapamil is considerably less efficacious than metoprolol in managing neurocardiogenic syncope.",

Sixty patients with early HD were randomized to chronic baclofen, 60 mg/day, or placebo treatments and followed systematically for up to 42 months. Total functional capacity was not favorably influenced by baclofen treatment. Factors that contributed, although nonsignificantly, to a more rapid rate of total functional capacity decline included younger age (less than 35 years), earlier stage (stage I) of illness, paternal inheritance of the HD gene, and baclofen treatment. Our patients declined at a pace slower than that observed in other prospective studies, a finding likely due to selection criteria, avoidance of neuroleptic therapy, and strong psychosocial support.",

        "document": "The purpose of this randomized, controlled, home care intervention was to test the effectiveness of two nurse-targeted, e-mail-based interventions to increase home care nurses' adherence to pain assessment and management guidelines, and to improve patient outcomes. Nurses from a large urban non-profit home care organization were assigned to usual care or one of two interventions upon identification of an eligible cancer patient with pain. The basic intervention consisted of a patient-specific, one-time e-mail reminder highlighting six pain-specific clinical recommendations. The augmented intervention supplemented the initial e-mail reminder with provider prompts, patient education material, and clinical nurse specialist outreach. Over 300 nurses were randomized and outcomes of 673 of their patients were reviewed. Data collection involved clinical record abstraction of nurse care practices and patient interviews completed approximately 45 days after start of care. The intervention had limited effect on nurse-documented care practices but patient outcomes were positively influenced. Patients in the augmented group improved significantly over the control group in ratings of pain intensity at its worst, whereas patients in the basic group had better ratings of pain intensity on average. Other outcomes measures were also positively influenced but did not reach statistical significance. Our findings suggest that although reminders have some role in improving cancer pain management, a more intensive approach is needed for a generalized nursing workforce with limited recent exposure to state-of-the-art pain management practices.",

        "document": "Twenty patients with clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis of a duration not exceeding 72 hours, and with the condition confirmed phlebographically, were randomly allocated to one of two groups in a double-blind study. In group 1 the patients received urokinase in a low-dose regimen of 200 000 Ploug units during the first 24 hours, followed by infusion of heparin, 40 000 units daily during the next 5 days. Patients in group 2 received heparin only, 40 000 units daily for 6 days. The clinical course was assessed daily. When the infusion period was completed, the phlebography was repeated, and the results of the two examinations were compared with respect to extent of filling defects and the degree of non-filling of the deep veins. We found no superiority in the regimen consisting of urokinase preceding heparin infusion, compared with that of heparin infusion alone. Most of the patients improved clinically during the 6-day infusion period, but the degree of thrombosis, evaluated phlebographically, was unaltered or even deteriorated during the period in all patients except two. Overt bleeding was noted in 6 patients.",

The main outcome variables examined were time to uterine quiescence, time gained in utero, recurrence of preterm labor, failure of tocolysis, and pertinent maternal and neonatal outcomes.\n                There were no significant differences in maternal demographic characteristics between the groups. Among patients who responded with uterine quiescence within 6 hours, there was a significant decrease in the time to uterine quiescence in the nicardipine group (P <.01). Patients in the magnesium sulfate group were more likely to have recurrence of preterm labor necessitating further tocolytic attempts (P =.048). The patients in the magnesium sulfate group had more adverse side effects, mainly nausea and vomiting (P =.004). There were no differences in birth weight, estimated gestational age at delivery, or neonatal complications between the 2 groups.\n                Oral nicardipine is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated tocolytic agent. In this prospective clinical trial patients randomly assigned to receive oral nicardipine had arrest of preterm labor more rapidly than did those randomly assigned to receive parenteral magnesium sulfate.

Thirteen centres recruited 99 patients with either a venous leg ulcer or a pressure ulcer. None of the wounds required systemic antibiotics or were associated with lymphangitis and/or fever, but at least two of the following criteria had to be present: continuous pain; erythema; oedema; heat; and moderate to high levels of serous exudate. Patients were allocated to receive either a silver-releasing hydroalginate dressing (Silvercel, the test group) or a pure calcium alginate dressing (Algosteril, the control group). Wounds were assessed daily over 14 days to complete a modified ASEPSIS index to evaluate risk of infection, and then weekly for two additional weeks. A global wound severity score and area tracings were recorded weekly.\n                Fifty-one and 48 patients were randomised in the test and control groups respectively: 28 pressure ulcers and 71 venous leg ulcers. The total mASEPSIS score over 14 days did not differ significantly between groups: 95.4 +/- 62.2 and 104.2 +/- 72.8 in control and test groups respectively (p = 0.791). Of the patients who completed the total four-week study duration, four out of 38 (10.5%) in the control group and none of the 40 in the test group were treated with systemic antibiotics at the final visit (p = 0.053). According to the investigators, fewer wounds developed a clinical infection over the four-week follow-up in the test group (33% versus 46%; p = 0.223). Overall, the four-week closure rate was statistically greater in the test group (0.32 +/- 0.57cm2/day versus 0.16 +/- 0.40cm2/day; p = 0.024). Compared with baseline, the absolute decrease in wound severity score at week four was higher in the test group (-5.6 +/- 3.2 versus -4.1 +/- 4.3; p = 0.063); this was also true of the percentage reduction (-32 +/- 17% versus -23 +/- 25%; p = 0.034).

However, the evaluation of these advantages in controlled clinical trials is complex and requires potent studies and the development of more specific endpoints than those currently used.",

In the 40 patients (19 HA-coated, 21 cemented) remaining at 5 years, the magnitude of the micromotion between the HA-coated and cemented groups did not differ. The HA-coated implants displayed most of the migration within the initial 3 months then stabilized, whereas the cemented implants showed an initially lower, but over time continuously increasing migration. Between 1 and 2 years, 4 of 24 HA-coated and 10 of 23 cemented implants migrated >0.2 mm and were categorized unstable, which has been shown to have a prognostic value as regards future aseptic loosening. Progressive radiolucent lines developed in 2 cemented knees, which both were categorized unstable.

Mucus clearance and lung function were measured during 14-day baseline and treatment periods.\n                Long-term inhalation of hypertonic saline without pretreatment with amiloride (i.e., with placebo pretreatment) resulted in a sustained (> or =8 hours) increase in 1-hour rates of mucus clearance, as compared with those with amiloride pretreatment (14.0+/-2.0 vs. 7.0+/-1.5 percent, respectively; P=0.02) and increased 24-hour rates of mucus clearance over baseline. Furthermore, inhalation of hypertonic saline with placebo improved the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) between the baseline period and the treatment period (mean difference, 6.62 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 11.7; P=0.02), whereas hypertonic saline with amiloride did not improve FEV1 (mean difference, 2.9 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -2.2 to 8.0; P=0.23).

A comparison of the changes in lung function in the two groups showed no significant difference. In vitro data suggested that sustained hydration of airway surfaces was responsible for the sustained improvement in mucus clearance, whereas inhibition of osmotically driven water transport by amiloride accounted for the observed loss of clinical benefit.\n                In patients with cystic fibrosis, inhalation of hypertonic saline produced a sustained acceleration of mucus clearance and improved lung function.

At week 8, the proportion of responders (> or = 50% decrease in MADRS) was 69% (escitalopram) and 58% (duloxetine) (p < 0.05) and remission (MADRS < or = 12) rates were 56% (escitalopram) and 48% (duloxetine) (NS). For the primary endpoint, the mean change from baseline in total MADRS score at week 24 was -23.4 for patients treated with escitalopram and -21.7 for patients treated with duloxetine, a difference of 1.7 points (p = 0.055, one-sided). The difference in mean change from baseline in MADRS total score favoured escitalopram at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 (p < 0.05). The overall withdrawal rates were 22% (escitalopram) and 25% (duloxetine) (NS). The withdrawal rate due to adverse events was lower for escitalopram (9%) compared to duloxetine (17%) (p < 0.05) and significantly more patients treated with duloxetine reported insomnia (12.6% vs. 4.9%) and constipation (8.6% vs. 2.8%).\n                Escitalopram was superior to duloxetine in acute treatment and at least as efficacious and better tolerated in long-term treatment of MDD.",

This study assessed time to treatment failure with 24 mg/day sertindole or 10 mg/day haloperidol in 282 clinically stable neuroleptic-responsive outpatients with schizophrenia. During a 5-week transition period, patients were randomized to treatment with sertindole or haloperidol; other treatments were gradually discontinued. Patients then received treatment through Day 365. Time to treatment failure was numerically superior in sertindole-treated patients compared with haloperidol-treated patients, although this difference was not statistically significant. Sertindole-treated patients, however, remained free of hospitalization for exacerbation of schizophrenia and remained medically compliant significantly longer than did haloperidol-treated patients. In addition, there were significantly fewer reports of EPS in sertindole-treated patients and sertindole therapy was generally well tolerated. Patients transitioned well from other antipsychotic agents to sertindole. Sertindole appears to be an effective long-term treatment for schizophrenia.",

Consecutive patients were given either placebo or prednisone in a double-blinded manner for 4 weeks (0.6 mg/kg/day in the first two weeks, 0.45 mg/kg/day in the third week and 0.25 mg/kg/day in the last week), and then, after a 2 week pause, therapy with interferon was instituted for a total of 12 weeks. Interferon was given by intramuscular injection in a single daily dose of 10 x 10(6) IU for 5 days and three times weekly thereafter. However, because of side effects, the dose of interferon was occasionally reduced to 5 x 10(6) IU in most patients. Interferon induced a sustained cessation of HBV replication as judged by loss of DNA-polymerase activity in 26 (59%) patients, 20 (45%) patients seroconverted to anti-HBe. Additionally, 6 (14%) cases lost HBsAg and seroconverted to anti-HBs. Prednisone pretreatment did not seem to improve the efficacy of interferon therapy. The outcome of the treatment was unrelated to gender and pretreatment activity of transaminases, however, patients with low activity of HBV replication were more likely to respond to therapy than patients with high HBV replication.",

Catheter-related sepsis (CRS) is the most commonly reported complication. The aim of this study was to compare sepsis rates between neonates receiving PN by CVC and by peripheral cannula. Neonates were randomized to receive PN either by CVC or by peripheral cannula. Primary outcomes were sepsis rates and efficacy of PN delivery. Interim analysis (49 neonates) revealed no difference in sepsis rates (CVC group 46%, cannula group 40%, p = 0.57). There was a significant discrepancy in PN delivered (median deficit 3.2% in the CVC group, 10.3% in the cannula group, p=0.0014). After consideration of these findings the study was terminated. Conclusion: Because the trial was stopped early, small but clinically important differences in the rates of sepsis may have been missed. Neonates in the cannula group accrued significant deficits of PN owing to a lack of venous access. This may contribute to undernutrition in neonates. CVC can be advocated for PN administration, in that sepsis appears to be no higher than when using cannulae and delivery of nutrition is significantly better.",

Between September 1980 and June 1982, we implemented five injury prevention projects concurrently in nine Massachusetts cities and town; five sites, matched on selected demographic characteristics, were control communities. An estimated 42 percent of households with children ages 0-5 years were exposed to one or more of the interventions over the two-year period in the nine communities. Participation in safety programs increased three-fold in the intervention communities and two-fold in the control communities. Safety knowledge and practices increased in both intervention and control communities. Households that reported participatory exposure to the interventions had higher safety knowledge and behavior scores than those that received other community exposure or no exposure to intervention activities. We found a distinct reduction in motor vehicle occupant injuries among children ages 0-5 years in the intervention compared with control communities, associated with participatory exposure of about 55 percent of households with children ages 0-5 years. We have no evidence that the coordinated intervention programs reduced the other target injuries--although exposure to prevention messages was associated with safety behaviors for burns and poisonings.",

        "document": "In thyroidectomized patients, increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are necessary to maximize I uptake. Traditionally, this has been achieved by withdrawing L-thyroxine (L-T4) for 4-6 weeks, inducing hypothyroidism in patients. The availability of a genetically engineered version of the recombinant human TSH (rh-TSH) provides an alternative tool to enhance the TSH serum level without inducing hypothyroidism. In this paper the I remnant and red-marrow doses calculated in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients pre-treated with rh-TSH are compared to those calculated in patients in hypothyroidism induced by L-T4 withdrawal.\n                Forty-six DTC patients, submitted to I ablative therapy, were randomly divided in group A (pre-treated with rh-TSH) and group B (treated after L-T4 withdrawal for 30 days). The red-marrow absorbed dose per unit administered activity and the remnant cumulated activity per unit administered activity were calculated for both groups.\n                The red-marrow dose in 17 rh-TSH treated patients is 0.06+/-0.02 mGy.MBq; that in 14 hypothyroid patients is 0.09+/-0.03 mGy.MBq (two-tailed unpaired t-test P=0.003). The remnant cumulated activity per unit administered activity in 10 rh-TSH treated patients is 0.9+/-0.8 h; that calculated in 21 hypothyroid patients is 1.55+/-1.05 h (two-tailed unpaired t-test P=0.063). This last result is mainly due to the difference between the maximum uptake (U) in rh-TSH (U=0.01+/-0.01) and hypothyroid patients (U=0.03+/-0.02) (two-tailed unpaired t-test P=0.019).\n                The rh-TSH pre-treated patients seem to have a lower uptake compared to those in hypothyroidism induced by L-T4 withdrawal. On the other hand their red-marrow absorbed dose seems to be lower.",

The median time to onset of analgesia was significantly shorter with effervescent acetaminophen (20 minutes) compared to tablet acetaminophen (45 minutes). During the first 45 minutes after administration, effervescent acetaminophen was significantly more effective at each scheduled assessment time than tablet acetaminophen. The median time to meaningful pain relief was significantly shorter with effervescent acetaminophen (45 minutes) compared to tablet acetaminophen (60 minutes). At 4 hours after administration, the pain relief was significantly better with tablet acetaminophen than with effervescent acetaminophen.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the oral route of misoprostol was as effective as the vaginal route of misoprostol 1 day after mifepristone. A prospective, open-labeled, randomized trial of healthy adult women up to 63 days pregnant and wanting a medical abortion were randomized to use either two doses of oral misoprostol 400 microg taken 2 h apart or misoprostol 800 microg vaginally. Women self-administered misoprostol 1 day after taking one-third of the standard dose of mifepristone (200 mg) orally. Women then returned to the clinic up to 5 days later for a repeat sonogram evaluation. A dose of vaginal misoprostol was administered to women with a continuing pregnancy who then returned 1 day later to Day 15. The primary outcome measures were a complete medical abortion by the first or by the second follow-up visits. Surgical intervention was indicated for continuing pregnancy at the second follow-up visit, excessive bleeding, or persistent products of conception 5 weeks later. One thousand one hundred sixty-eight women were enrolled. Of the 1144 (98%) women who complied with their random assignment, two oral doses of misoprostol (800 microg total) were 90% effective at inducing an abortion by the first follow-up visit, compared with one dose of misoprostol by vagina of 97% (chi(2) = 23.95, p = 0.001). By the second follow-up visit, the complete abortion rate was 95% for oral misoprostol and 99% for vaginal misoprostol (chi(2) = 21.76, p = 0.001). There were minimal differences in side effects. Women preferred the oral route. The trial demonstrated that although two doses of oral misoprostol were effective, the vaginal misoprostol was more effective at inducing an early medical abortion at 1 day after low-dose mifepristone, and the regimen could be extended to 63 days gestation.",

The intervention group students participated in the program, whereas the control group students received their scheduled personal development and health class.\n                The program significantly improved the body satisfaction of the intervention students and significantly changed aspects of their self-esteem; social acceptance, physical appearance, and athletic ability became less important for the intervention students and more important for control students. Female intervention students rated their physical appearance as perceived by others significantly higher than control students and allowed their body weight to increase appropriately by preventing the age increase in weight-losing behaviors of the control students. One year after the intervention, body image and attitude changes were still present. These findings also held for the 116 students (63% females) with low self-esteem and higher anxiety, who were considered at risk for the development of eating disorders. These students also had significantly lower drive for thinness and greater body satisfaction following the intervention and the decreased importance of physical appearance to their self-esteem was present at 12 months. Control at-risk students significantly decreased their body weight, whereas the weight of the intervention at-risk students significantly increased. The intervention program was effective, safe, having no effect on measures of students' anxiety or depression, and was rated highly by students.\n                This is the first controlled educational intervention to successfully improve body image and to produce long-term changes in the attitudes and self-image of young adolescents.

Six hour urine output increased from a mean (SE) of 3.3 (0.4) ml/kg/hour to 5.9 (0.8) ml/kg/hour following intravenous frusemide administration while nebulised frusemide had no effect on urine output. Urinary sodium, potassium, and chloride losses were also significantly higher after intravenous frusemide, whereas nebulised frusemide did not increase urinary electrolyte losses.\n                Single dose nebulised frusemide improves pulmonary function in premature infants with evolving chronic lung disease without adverse effects on fluid and electrolyte balance.",

        "document": "Bacterial infections frequently occur early after liver transplantation. We recently reported significant progress with a synbiotic composition, consisting of one lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and one fiber, which reduced the infection rate from 48% (with selective bowel decontamination) to 13%. Now, our aim is to study if a combination of different LAB and fibers would further improve outcome. A prospective randomized double-blind trial was undertaken in 66 liver transplant recipients. All patients received enteral nutrition immediately post-operatively. Comparison was made between one group (A) receiving a composition of four LAB and four fibers and another group (B) receiving the fibers only. The treatment started the day before surgery and continued for 14 days. Thirty-day infection rate, length of hospital stay, duration of antibiotic therapy, non-infectious complications and side effects of enteral nutrition were recorded. The incidence of post-operative bacterial infections was significantly reduced; being 48% with only fibers and 3% with LAB and fibers. In addition, the duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter in the latter group. In both groups, mainly mild or moderate infections occurred. Fibers and LAB were well tolerated. Early enteral nutrition supplemented with a mixture of LAB and fibers reduces bacterial infection rates following liver transplantation. Treatment with only fibers led to a low incidence of severe infections.",

        "document": "Progestins have definite activity against advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. Both parenteral and oral progestins yield similar serum levels and response rates, which range from 18% to 34%. The one major study that used oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) noted a response rate at the lower end of the range (18%) and much poorer progression-free and overall survival times (4 and 10.5 months, respectively) than previously reported. The present study sought to confirm this earlier study of oral MPA, to assess the importance of prognostic factors such as histologic grade and receptor levels, and to determine whether a higher dose of MPA would yield a higher response rate.\n                Two hundred ninety-nine eligible women with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma were randomized to receive oral MPA either 200 mg/d or 1, 000 mg/d until unacceptable toxicity intervened or their disease progressed.\n                Among 145 patients receiving the low-dose regimen, there were 25 complete (17%) and 11 partial (8%) responses for an overall response rate of 25%. The 154 patients receiving the high-dose regimen experienced 14 (9%) complete and 10 (6%) partial responses for an overall response rate of 15%. Median durations of progression-free survival were 3.2 months and 2.5 months for the low-dose and high-dose regimens, respectively. Median survival durations were 11.1 months and 7.0 months, respectively. The adjusted relative odds of responding to the high-dose regimen compared with the low-dose regimen was 0.61 (90% confidence interval, 0.36 to 1.04). Prognostic factors having a significant impact on the probability of response included initial performance status, age, histologic grade, and progesterone receptor concentration. Compliance with oral therapy was documented with serum levels 1 month after starting therapy, when possible. MPA levels were commensurate with the assigned dose and schedule.\n                Oral MPA is active against endometrial carcinoma. Response to progestin therapy is more frequent among patients with a well-differentiated histology and positive progesterone receptor status. This study provides no evidence to support the use of MPA 1,000 mg/d orally instead of MPA 200 mg/d orally. In fact, the trends suggest the opposite. The use of oral MPA 200 mg/d is a reasonable initial approach to the treatment of advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma, particularly those lesions that are well-differentiated and/or progesterone receptor-positive (> 50 fmol/mg cytosol protein). Patients with poorly differentiated and/or progesterone receptor levels less than 50 fmol/mg cytosol protein had only an 8% to 9% response rate.",

It was found that none of the patients died who received AA along with the conventional antitetanus therapy. On the other hand, 74.2 per cent of the tetanus patients who received the conventional antitetanus therapy without AA (control group) were succumbed to the infection. In the other age group of 13-30 years, there were 27 and 38 patients in the treatment and control groups respectively. The mortality in the AA and control groups were 37 percent and 67.8 percent respectively. These results suggest that AA might play an important role in reducing the mortality of tetanus. This was supported by the fact that AA was found to mitigate the toxic effects of strychnine producing tetanus like condition in young chicks in the present study.",

Specifically, students who received the intervention showed decreased intention to engage in sex and increased abstinence compared with students not receiving the intervention. Effects for 1-year follow-up, with smaller sample size, showed only that AIM male participants maintained the significant abstinence effect.\n                A new intervention, AIM was evaluated among African-American seventh graders.

In infants with poor lung function (dynamic lung compliance: <0.5 mL/kg/cm H(2)O; expiratory airway resistance: >70 cm H(2)O/L/s), successful extubation was seen in 93% (27 of 29) in the SNIPPV group and 60% (15 of 25) in the NCPAP group. When weight was controlled for at the time of extubation, the odds of success in the SNIPPV group were 21.1 times higher (95% confidence interval: 3.4, 130.1) than that of the NCPAP group.\n                SNIPPV is more effective than NCPAP in weaning infants with RDS from the ventilator.

For Arms A and C, 66-70 Gy in 33-35 fractions, 5 days a week, were administered in 6.5-7 weeks to tumor and positive nodes. In Arm B, the dose delivered to tumor and involved nodes was 64-67.2 Gy, giving 2 fractions of 1.6 Gy every day with an interfraction interval of at least 4 h and preferably 6 h, 5 days a week. At 38.4 Gy, a 2-week split was planned; after the split, RT was resumed with the same modality. In Arm C, CT regimen consisted of carboplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CBDCA 75 mg/m(2), Days 1-4; 5-FU 1,000 mg/m(2) i.v. over 96 h, Days 1-4, recycling every 28 days (at 1st, 5th, and 9th week).\n                No statistically significant difference was detected in overall survival (p = 0.129): 40% Arm A vs. 37% Arm B vs. 51% Arm C were alive at 24 months. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of event-free survival (p = 0.196): 20% for Arm A, 19% for Arm B, and 37% for Arm C were event free at 24 months. On the contrary, the 2-year disease-free survival was significantly different among the three arms (p = 0.022), with a superiority for Arm C. At 24 months, the proportion of patients without relapse was 42% for Arm C vs. 23% for Arm A and 20% for Arm B. Patients in Arm A less frequently developed G3+ acute mucositis than their counterparts in Arm B or C (14.7% vs. 40.3% vs. 44%). Regarding the CT-related acute toxicity, apart from 1 case of fatal nephrotoxicity, only hematologic G3+ (Grade 3 or higher) acute sequelae were observed (World Health Organization scale), most commonly leukopenia (22.7%). Arm C showed slightly more G3+ skin, s.c. tissue, and mucosal late side effects (RTOG scale), although significant sequelae were relatively uncommon, and mucosal sequelae were most commonly transient. The occurrence of persistent G3 xerostomia was comparable in all three treatment arms.\n                The combination of simultaneous CT and RT with the regimen of this trial is better than RT alone in advanced oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinomas, by increasing disease-free survival. This improvement, however, did not translate into an overall survival improvement, and was associated with a higher incidence of acute morbidity.",

The method used was an open randomized clinical trial including 79 patients who received either norfloxacin 400 mg/day or rufloxacin 400 mg/week and followed up for one year. E. coli counts, quinolone susceptibility, and drug concentrations in feces were investigated in 12 patients. Cumulative one-year probability of peritonitis recurrence was 26% for patients on norfloxacin and 36% for those on rufloxacin (P = 0.16). Norfloxacin was more effective in the prevention of peritonitis recurrence due to Enterobacteriaceae (0% vs 22%, P = .01). At the end of follow-up, all 12 patients had E. coli resistant to quinolones in their feces. In conclusion, weekly rufloxacin is not an alternative to daily norfloxacin in the prevention of peritonitis recurrence.

The sensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium, which are cell layers in zinc, appear to be prominently involved in the disease process. Because zinc plays a role in the metabolic function of several important enzymes in the chorioretinal complex, we undertook a prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled investigation of the effects of oral zinc administration on the visual acuity outcome in 151 subjects with drusen or macular degeneration. Although some eyes in the zinc-treated group lost vision, this group had significantly less visual loss than the placebo group after a follow-up of 12 to 24 months. This is the first controlled oral intervention study to show a positive, if limited, treatment effect in macular degeneration, a major public health problem. Because of the pilot nature of the study and the possible toxic effects and complications of oral zinc administration, widespread use of zinc in macular degeneration is not now warranted.",

        "document": "Evidence suggests that synthetic surfactants consisting solely of phospholipids can be improved through the addition of peptides, such as sinapultide, that mimic the action of human surfactant protein-B (SP-B). A synthetic surfactant containing a mimic of SP-B may also reduce the potential risks associated with the use of animal-derived products. Our objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of a novel synthetic surfactant containing a functional SP-B mimic (lucinactant; Discovery Laboratories, Doylestown, PA) with those of a non-protein-containing synthetic surfactant (colfosceril palmitate; GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, United Kingdom) and a bovine-derived surfactant (beractant; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) in the prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and RDS-related death.\n                We assigned randomly (double-masked) 1294 very preterm infants, weighing 600 to 1250 g and of < or =32 weeks gestational age, to receive colfosceril palmitate (n = 509), lucinactant (n = 527), or beractant (n = 258) within 20 to 30 minutes after birth. Primary outcome measures were the rates of RDS at 24 hours and the rates of death related to RDS during the first 14 days after birth. All-cause mortality rates, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) rates, and rates of other complications of prematurity were prespecified secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes, air leaks, and causes of death were assigned by an independent, masked, adjudication committee with prespecified definitions. The study was monitored by an independent data safety monitoring board.\n                Lucinactant reduced significantly the incidence of RDS at 24 hours, compared with colfosceril (39.1% vs 47.2%; odds ratio [OR]: 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.89). There was no significant difference in comparison with beractant (33.3%). However, lucinactant reduced significantly RDS-related mortality rates by 14 days of life, compared with both colfosceril (4.7% vs 9.4%; OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.25-0.73) and beractant (10.5%; OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.18-0.66). In addition, BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was significantly less common with lucinactant than with colfosceril (40.2% vs 45.0%; OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.56-0.99), and the all-cause mortality rate at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was lower with lucinactant than with beractant (21% vs 26%; OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45-1.00).\n                Lucinactant is a more effective surfactant preparation than colfosceril palmitate for the prevention of RDS. In addition, lucinactant reduces the incidence of BPD, compared with colfosceril palmitate, and decreases RDS-related mortality rates, compared with beractant. Therefore, we conclude that lucinactant, the first of a new class of surfactants containing a functional protein analog of SP-B, is an effective therapeutic option for preterm infants at risk for RDS.",

        "title": "Ropivacaine epidural anesthesia and analgesia versus general anesthesia and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine in the perioperative management of hip replacement. Ropivacaine Hip Replacement Multicenter Study Group.",
        "document": "The aim of our study was to compare epidural anesthesia and analgesia (EDA) with ropivacaine versus general anesthesia followed by IV patient-controlled analgesia with morphine (GA/PCA) after hip replacement regarding pain, side effects, and discharge from the postanesthesia care unit. After ethics committee approval, randomization, and informed consent, 90 patients were enrolled. In Group EDA, epidural anesthesia (ropivacaine 10 mg/mL, 15-25 mL) was followed by an epidural infusion (2 mg/mL, 4-6 mL/h for 24 h, plus top-up doses of 6-10 mL for 48 h). GA/PCA patients received general anesthesia (isoflurane/N2O/fentanyl) followed by IV patient-controlled analgesia with morphine postoperatively. Pain was assessed by using visual analog scales (0-100 mm) at rest and during physiotherapy. Pain at rest was less in the EDA (n = 43) group than in the GA/PCA (n = 45) group (at 10 h: 11.8+/-12.9 vs. 28.4+/-17.1 [P< 0.001]; at 24 h: 14.3+/-11.7 vs. 24.0+/-17 [P<0.01]; in 48 h: 14.3+/-9.3 vs. 21.1+/-17.4 [P = 0.1]). Whereas EDA patients were deemed ready for discharge from the postanesthesia care unit earlier than GA/PCA patients (5.6+/-8.9 vs. 39.7+/-41.5 min), the actual discharge time was comparable. The median time for first passage of flatus was shorter in the EDA group than in the GA/PCA group (26 vs. 47 h). Nausea and vomiting were more common in the GA/PCA group than in the EDA group (16% vs. 28% and 11% vs. 22%, respectively), whereas hypotension (11% vs. 4%) and bradycardia (14% vs. 2%) were less frequent. Under the conditions of the present study, EDA with ropivacaine provided pain control after hip replacement superior to that provided by IV patient-controlled analgesia with morphine, particularly during the first 24 h. Both approaches to pain management were equally safe.\n                Compared with general anesthesia and postoperative IV patient-controlled analgesia with morphine, epidural anesthesia and analgesia with the new local anesthetic ropivacaine enables patients to be discharged sooner from a postanesthesia care unit and provides superior pain relief during the first 24 h after hip replacement.",

        "document": "Recent controlled trials suggest that thrombolytic therapy may be an effective initial treatment for acute arterial occlusion of the legs. A major potential benefit of initial thrombolytic therapy is that limb ischemia can be managed with less invasive interventions.\n                In this randomized, multicenter trial conducted at 113 North American and European sites, we compared vascular surgery (e.g., thrombectomy or bypass surgery) with thrombolysis by catheter-directed intraarterial recombinant urokinase; all patients (272 per group) had had acute arterial obstruction of the legs for 14 days or less. Infusions were limited to a period of 48 hours (mean [+/-SE], 24.4+/-0.86), after which lesions were corrected by surgery or angioplasty if needed. The primary end point was the amputation-free survival rate at six months.\n                Final angiograms, which were available for 246 patients treated with urokinase, revealed recanalization in 196 (79.7 percent) and complete dissolution of thrombus in 167 (67.9 percent). Both treatment groups had similar significant improvements in mean ankle-brachial blood-pressure index. Amputation-free survival rates in the urokinase group were 71.8 percent at six months and 65.0 percent at one year, as compared with respective rates of 74.8 percent and 69.9 percent in the surgery group; the 95 percent confidence intervals for the differences were -10.5 to 4.5 percentage points at six months (P=0.43) and -12.9 to 3.1 percentage points at one year (P=0.23). At six months the surgery group had undergone 551 open operative procedures (excluding amputations), as compared with 315 in the thrombolysis group. Major hemorrhage occurred in 32 patients in the urokinase group (12.5 percent) as compared with 14 patients in the surgery group (5.5 percent) (P= 0.005). There were four episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the urokinase group (1.6 percent), one of which was fatal. By contrast, there were no episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the surgery group.\n                Despite its association with a higher frequency of hemorrhagic complications, intraarterial infusion of urokinase reduced the need for open surgical procedures, with no significantly increased risk of amputation or death.",

Several studies have reported terbinafine to be a safe and well-tolerated fungicidal drug for the treatment of this infection.

Patients were randomized to one of four oral terbinafine treatment arms (6, 8, 10 or 12 weeks treatment) or to an open label, 12-week, high-dose griseofulvin (20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) arm at a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio.

Mycological cure was obtained in 59% and 57%, respectively, and clinical cure in 76% and 80%. In the griseofulvin group, effective treatment was 88%, mycological cure was 76% and clinical cure 96%. However, these high rates were believed to be due to the high dosage of this drug and the prolonged course of treatment. Complete cure was observed at the end of study in 62% patients treated with terbinafine for 6 weeks, in 60% treated for 8 weeks and in 84% patients treated with griseofulvin for 12 weeks.\n                Although there was no statistical trend between the duration of terbinafine treatment within the groups for complete cure at the end of study, there was a positive correlation between the daily dose of terbinafine (mg x kg(-1)) and complete cure. Terbinafine therapy for 6 weeks could represent an alternative to griseofulvin for the treatment of Microsporum tinea capitis. However, further clinical trials are required in order to optimize the dose regimen to allow higher cure rates to be reached.",

There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of union (p = 0.93) and AVN at two years (p = 0.85). Posterior comminution, poor reduction and improper placement of the screws were the major factors contributing to nonunion. The overall incidence of AVN was 16.3% (15 of 92 patients) and it was not influenced by these factors.

Using data from the Unplugged school-based prevention trial, we investigated different patterns of smoking behavior development among secondary school students in the Czech Republic.\n                Growth mixture modeling was used to examine different trajectories in cigarette smoking behaviors among male and female students (N=1874 6th graders; 50.4% male, mean age 11.8 years at baseline) participating in the Unplugged school-based randomized control trial for substance use prevention.\n                A two-class model characterized cigarette use as a function of sex and Unplugged intervention status. More rapid cigarette use increases were observed in females (OR=1.17, p=0.01 in both rapid/moderate and slow smoking escalator classes) as compared to males. Further, in both classes, more rapid increases in smoking were observed for the control group as compared to the intervention group (OR=1.22, p<0.01 slow escalators; OR=1.54, p=0.08 rapid/moderate escalators). There was no difference in sex distribution when comparing the two classes (OR=1.02, p=0.98).\n                This study adds to a growing literature on developmental and sex differences in cigarette use among adolescents. This research supports additional multi-year prevention strategies aimed at adolescent females and early treatment programs for adolescent smokers to prevent increasing cigarette use with age.\n                Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Efficacy was evaluated using measures of cognition, daily function, and behavior. The primary efficacy measures were the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog/11) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) total score. Secondary outcomes included the Clinician's Interview Based on Impression of Change-Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus), Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and EXIT-25 for assessment of executive functioning. Safety and tolerability were also monitored.\n                Patients treated with galantamine had a greater improvement in ADAS-cog/11 after 26 weeks compared with placebo (-1.8 vs -0.3; p < 0.001). There was no difference between galantamine and placebo at week 26 on the ADCS-ADL score (0.7 vs 1.3; p = 0.783). Improvement in global functioning measured by the CIBIC-plus associated with galantamine approached significance (p = 0.069). A difference between treatment groups for EXIT-25 favoring galantamine was detected (p = 0.041). Safety data revealed that 13% of galantamine and 6% of placebo patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events.\n                Significance was not reached for both co-primary endpoints. Galantamine was effective for improving cognition, including executive function, in patients with vascular dementia, with good safety and tolerability. However, improvement in activities of daily living with galantamine was similar to that observed with placebo.",

        "document": "Several large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have found topiramate (TPM) to be effective and generally well tolerated as a preventive therapy for migraine.\n                This paper evaluates efficacy and safety data from a pilot study of TPM 200 mg/d as preventive therapy in adult subjects with a history of migraine with or without aura.\n                The pilot study had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive TPM 200 mg/d or placebo. The double-blind treatment phase consisted of an 8-week titration period (25 mg/d for the first week, followed by weekly increases of 25 mg) and a 12-week maintenance period. The primary efficacy measure was the change in mean monthly migraine frequency. Additional measures were the median percent reduction in monthly migraine frequency and the proportion of responders (those with > or =50%, > or =75%, or 100% reduction in monthly migraine frequency).\n                The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 211 subjects (138 TPM, 73 placebo; mean [SD] mean weight, 76.7 [18.7] kg). Of 45 subjects who discontinued the study in the TPM group, 21 discontinued during the titration period, compared with 3 of 13 subjects who discontinued in the placebo group. When the efficacy data were assessed using the per-protocol, analysis-of-covariance model, TPM 200 mg/d was not associated with a significant reduction in mean monthly migraine frequency compared with placebo. A post hoc analysis using a Poisson regression model in the ITT population suggested that TPM significantly reduced mean monthly migraine frequency compared with placebo (P=0.04). A significantly larger proportion of TPM-treated subjects had a > or =75% reduction in monthly migraine frequency compared with placebo (P=0.03). At least 1 adverse event was reported by 90.0% and 69.9% of the TPM and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) occurring in > or =10% of subjects in the TPM group were paresthesia (45%), dizziness (16%), fatigue (16%), nausea (14%), and weight loss (14%). Most treatment-emergent AEs were rated mild or moderate in severity. Of 3 serious AEs (depression, abdominal pain, leg pain) occurring during the trial, none were considered related to either TPM or placebo.\n                In this pilot study, mean monthly migraine frequency did not differ significantly between TPM and placebo.",

Ten patients were allocated to an experimental group and 7 to a control group. The patients in the experimental group received an elemental diet for 3 weeks, whereas the patients in the control group received a control soup consisting of milk, meat, fish, shellfish, orange, pineapples, tomatoes, peas and flour of wheat and corn. During the 4th week of the study the patients in both groups resumed their regular diet. A significant improvement was found in the number of tender joints (p = 0.04) in the experimental group, whereas improvement was found in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p = 0.03) and in the thrombocyte count (p = 0.02) in the control group. Three patients in the elemental diet group and 2 patients in the control group improved in all of the measured disease variables during the dietary treatment period. There was no significant difference in disease activity variables between the two groups. These results suggest that some RA patients may respond to the elimination of offending food items. However, the results do not encourage treatment with an elemental diet in unselected RA patients.",

A study cardiologist and a CHF nurse evaluated each patient and made recommendations to the patient's primary physician before randomization. The intervention team consisted of a cardiologist, a CHF nurse, a telephone nurse coordinator and the patient's primary physician. Contact with the patient was on a prespecified schedule. The CHF nurse followed an algorithm to adjust medications. Patients in the nonintervention group were followed as usual. The primary outcome was the composite of the number of CHF hospital admissions and deaths over six months, compared by using a log transformation t test by intention-to-treat analysis.\n                The median age of the study patients was 63.5 years, and 39.5% were women. There were 43 CHF hospital admissions and 7 deaths in the intervention group, as compared with 59 CHF hospital admissions and 13 deaths in the nonintervention group (p = 0.09). The quality-of-life score, percentage of patients on target vasodilator therapy and percentage of patients compliant with diet recommendations were significantly better in the intervention group. Cost per patient, in 1998 U.S. dollars, was similar in both groups.\n                This study demonstrates that a six-month, multidisciplinary approach to CHF management can improve important clinical outcomes at a similar cost in recently hospitalized high-risk patients with CHF.",

Such patients may benefit from longer treatment, however, because they appear to have an increased risk of recurrence after anticoagulant therapy is stopped.\n                In this double-blind study, we randomly assigned patients who had completed 3 months of anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of idiopathic venous thromboembolism to continue receiving warfarin, with the dose adjusted to achieve an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0, or to receive placebo for a further 24 months. Our goal was to determine the effects of extended anticoagulant therapy on rates of recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism and bleeding.\n                A prespecified interim analysis of efficacy led to the early termination of the trial after 162 patients had been enrolled and followed for an average of 10 months.

At the last follow-up visit, patients treated with neuroreflexotherapy showed greater improvement than did control patients in low back pain (visual analogue scale, 5.5; range, 3.7-8.8 vs. 1.9; range, -1.2-3.0; P < 0.001); referred pain (visual analogue scale, 3.6; range, 2.7-7.3 vs. 0.6; range, -1.5-2.0; P = 0.001); and disability (Roland-Morris scale, 8.7; range, 2.0-13.3 vs. 2.0; range, -1.5-6.7; P = 0.007). Moreover, neuroreflexotherapy intervention was associated with a significantly (P < 0.035) lower number of consultations to private or public specialists, fewer indications of radiographs by primary care physicians, lower cost of drug treatment, and less duration of sick leave throughout the follow-up period. There were also differences in favor of neuroreflexotherapy intervention in the cost-effectiveness ratio for pain, disability, and quality of life that persisted in the most optimistic, the most conservative, and the average (break-even case) assumptions.\n                Referral to neuroreflexotherapy intervention improves the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the management of nonspecific low back pain.",

        "document": "Ketamine has been administered epidurally and intrathecally for operative and post-operative pain control. Animal studies showed potentiation of analgesia induced by ketamine and morphine. We hypothesized that intrathecal ketamine would potentiate the effects of intrathecal morphine in the treatment of cancer pain.\n                A double blind, cross over study was designed to evaluate the effect of ketamine on spinal morphine analgesia in terminal cancer pain patients. A two-phase protocol was used; phase M, intrathecal morphine alone twice daily; phase M + K, co-administration of ketamine (1.0 mg) with morphine intrathecally twice daily. The dose of morphine was titrated upwards until acceptable pain relief was achieved, defined by numeric rating scales (0-10) < or = 3, and the rescue dose of morphine was less than 5 mg after each intrathecal administration for two days. The dose of intrathecal morphine was defined as the effective dose.\n                The effective dose of intrathecal morphine in phase M of 0.38 +/- 0.04 mg.day-1 was higher than that in phase M + K (0.17 +/- 0.02 mg.day-1) (P < 0.05). The average pain scales were 7.95 +/- 0.25 before intrathecal drug administration. Pain scales were decreased to 2.2 +/- 0.17 (P < 0.05) in phase M and 1.95 +/- 0.20 (P < 0.05) in phase M + K after the effective dose of morphine had been reached. No serious side effects were observed in this study.\n                The present study demonstrates that ketamine enhances the analgesic effect of morphine, thus reducing the dose of intrathecal morphine.",

Seven primary care clinics were randomly assigned to the two programmes-three to the standard programme and four to the new programme.\n                Over a 2-year period, 15,994 women were recruited into the study at the time they booked antenatal care. 97% of the women were followed up, 9,394 who had followed the new programme, and 6,138 from clinics with the standard one. Women allocated to the new programme made, as planned, fewer visits than those in the standard programme (median 4 vs 6 visits, respectively). The proportion of antenatal referrals was also lower (13.6 vs 15.3%; odds ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.79-0.95]) because of significantly fewer referrals for pregnancy-induced hypertension (2.5 vs 3.8%; 0.66 [0.55-0.79]). Nevertheless, there were significantly fewer labour referrals for severe hypertension or eclampsia (2.1 vs 2.6%; 0.81 [0.66-1.00]). The risk for preterm (< 37 weeks) delivery was significantly lower for women on the new programme (10.1 vs 11.5%; 0.86 [0.78-0.96]).

Therefore, these studies were designed to test the hypothesis that diets enriched with fish oil would decrease the incidence of thrombosis in newly constructed polytetrafluorethylene grafts. A double-blind, randomized trial was conducted. Twenty-four patients were randomized to receive 4000 mg of fish oil or 4000 mg of control oil. Both preparations were enriched with antioxidants and deodorized with peppermint. Patients began therapy within 2 wk after graft placement and were monitored for 12 mo or until thrombosis developed. With a permuted-block randomization schedule, 12 patients received fish oil and 12 patients received control oil. The primary patency rates at 365 d were 14.9% for the control group and 75.6% for the fish oil-treated group. Survival analysis revealed a significant difference between fish oil-treated and untreated patients (P < 0.03, Mantel-Cox test), with a power of 90%. Moreover, analysis of covariables, including age of > or =50 yr, gender, race, body weight, diabetes mellitus, bleeding times, and lipid profiles, indicated that this effect occurred principally as a result of fish oil administration. Importantly, fish oil treatment also decreased venous outflow resistance and systemic BP, compared with control values. Fish oils possess unique biologic properties that favorably affect the incidence of polytetrafluorethylene graft thrombosis, and they thus represent a potential treatment strategy for the prevention of access thrombosis.",

While some investigators have examined the efficacy of these agents in treating NAS, there are no data regarding the use of specific pharmacologic agents and developmental outcome. This study evaluated 85 infants born to drug-dependent women who were maintained on methadone during pregnancy. Severity of infant withdrawal was assessed with the neonatal abstinence scoring system. Infants who required pharmacotherapy were randomly assigned to one of four treatment regimens: paragoric, phenobarbital (titration), phenobarbital (loading), and diazepam. When treatment was not successful with the assigned agent, one of the other agent(s) was used. At 6 months of age, the developmental status of infants was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Mental Development. Based on NAS treatment, four groups were defined: paregoric (n = 21); phenobarbital (n = 17); more than one agent (n = 31); and no treatment (n = 16). Data for the phenobarbital loading and titration groups were combined since analysis revealed no differences between groups. All infants who initially received diazepam were included in group III since diazepam as a single agent was not successful. Results of one way analysis of variance revealed no differences in developmental status between groups (p greater than 0.10, F = 0.25).

Tracheal intubation was performed without a muscle relaxant. Anaesthesia was continued with the volatile anaesthetic, adjusted to maintain heart rate and blood pressure within +/-20% of initial values. Recovery was evaluated using a modified Aldrete score, a Pain/Discomfort scale and by measuring recovery end-points. A postoperative questionnaire was used to determine the well-being of the child at home until 24 h after discharge.\n                Emergence and interaction occurred significantly earlier after sevoflurane than halothane but discharge times were similar. More children in the sevoflurane group achieved full Aldrete scores within the first 30 min after anaesthesia, although this group suffered more discomfort during the first 10 min. The amount of postoperative analgesic administered was higher and the first dose given earlier in the sevoflurane group. Postoperative vomiting was more common with halothane, but side-effects in the two groups were otherwise similar in the recovery room and at home.\n                In children 1-3 yr, sevoflurane provided more rapid early recovery but not discharge after anaesthesia of <30-min duration. Apart from more vomiting with halothane and more discomfort during the first 10 min after awakening with sevoflurane, the quality of recovery was similar with the two anaesthestics.",

Fourteen ventilated infants were studied. TcPCO2 was measured and recorded in prone, supine, and right-side-lying positions for each subject. There were no statistically significant differences in mean TcPCO2 values between the three positions (F = .45; df 2,39; P = .64). The relationship between TcPCO2 and PaCO2 values was stable (r = .88) during the studies.

The primary outcome variables were determination of the lowest stable methylprednisolone dose and assessment of corticosteroid side effects. Methylprednisolone dose was adjusted to maintain optimal control of asthma symptoms. A total of 30 patients receiving TAO and 27 patients receiving placebo completed 1 yr; 17 on TAO and 8 on placebo completed 2 yr of double-blind participation. Control of asthma was equivalent in both groups. The vast majority of patients in both groups achieved alternate-day dosing (29 of 30 on TAO and 23 of 27 on placebo in the first year). The lowest stable doses of methylprednisolone achieved were 10.4 mg/day (placebo) versus 6.3 mg/day (TAO) in the 1-yr group (p = 0.03). However, the baseline dose was also significantly higher in the placebo group (22.8 versus 17.6 mg/day in the TAO group). Therefore, the reductions in methylprednisolone dose were not significantly different between treatment groups. Differences were observed between the two treatment groups in serum IgG, fasting blood sugar, serum cholesterol, and progression of osteoporosis. In each instance the more unfavorable response occurred in those subjects receiving TAO. We conclude that the addition of TAO to methylprednisolone was not accompanied by a reduction in corticosteroid side effects compared with treatment with methylprednisolone alone. Furthermore, no evidence was found for a subset of \"TAO responders.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Of great concern is the possibility of HIV transmission during the assault, but adherence to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) has been varied and low. We developed a telephonic psycho-social support, leaflet and adherence diary intervention for rape victims and tested its impact on adherence to PEP. A randomised control trial was conducted in the Western and Eastern Cape and 279 rape survivors were enrolled in two arms. The intervention involved the providing of an information leaflet including an adherence diary and follow-up support through telephone calls by a counsellor during the 28 days of taking the PEP. The controls received the leaflet. Follow-up interviews and tablet checks were done with 253 participants to assess adherence. The primary outcome was completion of 28 days of PEP with no more than three missed doses (94% adherence). There was more adherence in the intervention arm (38.2% vs. 31.9%), but the estimated intervention effect of 6.5% (95% CI: -4.6 to 17.6%) was not statistically significant, p=0.13. The intervention was associated with the reading of the pamphlet (p=0.07) and an increased use of the diary (p=0.01), but did not reduce depressive psychopathology. Overall adherence was greater amongst those who read the leaflet and used the medication diary. The study showed that the intervention was not effective in significantly improving adherence and adherence levels were low in both study arms. Further research to understand reasons for non-adherence is needed before further interventions are developed.",

        "document": "The treatment of epilepsy with carbamazepine (CBZ) may be hampered by cognitive side effects. These side effects are thought to be related to pharmacokinetic properties of the drug. The serum concentration of CBZ is characterized by rapid absorption and a short half-life, which may lead to a considerable fluctuation of the level between doses. Cognitive defects may result from peak levels: short periods with high serum concentration. In a single-blind crossover design, cognitive performance was compared in three conditions. All patients were first tested in the steady state of conventional CBZ. The patients were then assigned randomly to either CBZ-controlled release (CR) or a condition in which conventional CBZ was administered in the same tablet form and dose frequency as CR. Psychological tests were administered four times daily, immediately after the serum samples were taken. A nonmedication control group was tested following the same test scheme to obtain standards for the evaluation of changes in performance during the day. A systematic tendency was found toward higher test performance in the CR condition. This is especially evident for tests of memory and accuracy of visual information processing. The results of the repeated test procedure show that the smoothing effect of the CR condition on serum concentration fluctuations results in a more stable pattern of cognitive functioning during the day.",

        "document": "The role of calcium accumulation in the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has already been discussed. Several trials with different calcium-blocking drugs have revealed no clinical benefit. In addition, the present study includes histological investigations and computer tomography to verify therapeutic effects. In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study, 13 DMD patients aged from 3-10 years (mean, 7 years) were treated with 5 mg/kg diltiazem daily for 1 year. Compared with before therapy, the number of calcium-positive muscular fibres was remarkably reduced in the treated DMD patients, but not in the placebo group. The evaluation of all other biochemical and clinical parameters revealed no significant effects of the diltiazem therapy. The muscular X-ray density measured by computer tomography decreased under treatment. After the evaluation of the double-blind study, the code was broken. Therapy, however, was continued in the treated group and started in the placebo group. After 3 years of diltiazem therapy the clinical status of all 26 patients of the study and 20 additional DMD patients who were treated with diltiazem was compared with 46 untreated DMD patients of the same age and stage in our department. No obvious clinical benefit of diltiazem therapy could be observed.",

Thirty-five healthy pregnant women with severe pedal edema were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. The experimental group (n = 17) received EPIC for 30 minutes at 40 torr while in the left lateral recumbent position. Control women (n = 18) were similarly positioned, but received no EPIC. Both groups walked for 10 minutes following left lateral posturing. Circumference measures required for leg volume estimates were made: prior to posturing (Time 1), immediately after posturing (Time 2), and following the ambulation period (Time 3). Volume losses for the experimental group were greater than for the control group at Time 2. Although volume losses for the experimental group had reversed somewhat at Time 3, they remained greater than control group losses, which did not change from Time 2 to Time 3. Analysis of covariance revealed significant mean volume losses for both experimental and control groups, with ponderal index the only significant covariate.",

        "document": "Opioids delay gastric emptying, which in turn may increase the risk of vomiting and pulmonary aspiration. Naloxone reverses this opiate action on gastric emptying, but it is not known whether this effect in humans is mediated by central or peripheral opiate antagonism. The importance of peripheral opioid receptor antagonism in modulating opioid-induced delay in gastric emptying was evaluated using methylnaltrexone, a quaternary derivative of the opiate antagonist naltrexone, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier.\n                In a randomized, double-blind, crossover placebo-controlled study, 11 healthy volunteers were given either placebo (saline), 0.09 mg/kg morphine, or 0.09 mg/kg morphine plus 0.3 mg/kg methylnaltrexone on three separate occasions before ingesting 500 ml deionized water. The rate of gastric emptying was measured by two methods: a noninvasive epigastric bioimpedance technique and the acetaminophen absorption test.\n                The epigastric bioimpedance technique was sufficiently sensitive to detect opioid-induced changes in the rate of gastric emptying. The mean +/- SD time taken for the gastric volume to decrease to 50% (t0.5) after placebo was 5.5 +/- 2.1 min. Morphine prolonged gastric emptying to (t0.5) of 21 +/- 9.0 min (P < 0.03). Methylnaltrexone given concomitantly with morphine reversed the morphine-induced delay in gastric emptying to a t0.5 of 7.4 +/- 3.0 (P < 0.04). Maximum concentrations and area under the concentration curve from 0 to 90 min of serum acetaminophen concentrations after morphine were significantly different from placebo and morphine administered concomitantly with methylnaltrexone (P < 0.05). No difference in maximum concentration or area under the concentration curve from 0 to 90 min was noted between placebo and methylnaltrexone coadministered with morphine.\n                The attenuation of morphine-induced delay in gastric emptying by methylnaltrexone suggests that the opioid effect is mediated outside the central nervous system. Methylnaltrexone may have the potential to decrease the side effects of opioid medications, which are mediated peripherally, while maintaining the central analgesia effect of the opioid.",

        "document": "The objective of this study was to investigate whether routine medical testing before cataract surgery reduces the rate of complications during the perioperative period in adults.\n                The study was carried out in an academic medical center in Brazil, between 10 February 2000 and 10 January 2001. The scheduled cataract operations were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) to be preceded by routine testing (the \"routine-testing group\") or 2) not to be preceded by routine medical testing (the \"selective-testing group\"). If the patient was assigned to the selective-testing group, it was requested that no preoperative testing be performed unless the patient presented with a new or worsening medical problem that would warrant medical evaluation with testing. In the case of patients assigned to the routine-testing group, three tests were requested: a 12-lead electrocardiogram, a complete blood count, and measurements of serum glucose.\n                The sample of 1,025 patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery was comprised of 512 assigned to the routine-testing group and of 513 assigned to the selective-testing group. The two groups had similar proportions of operations canceled and not subsequently rescheduled, 2% in each group. The cumulative rate of medical events was similar in the two groups, 9.6% in the routine-testing group and 9.7% in the selective-testing group (P = 0.923). The types of medical events were also similar in both groups.\n                The results of this study suggest that routine medical testing before cataract surgery does not reduce the rate of complications during the perioperative period. The results also suggest it would be more efficient not to request routine preoperative tests unless indicated by patient history or physical examination.",

A third group (group 3) had their peritonsillar region infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine after the completion of surgery but before the patients were awakened from anesthesia. All the patients were treated in the same way in the postoperative period: NSAIDs were given intravenously to adults and rectally to children. Acetaminophen was given intravenously or rectally (children aged < 15 yr) if additional analgesic support was requested by the patient. Additional acetaminophen consumption was recorded daily. Pain scores were assessed on every patient with the use of a visual analogue scale (VAS) at rest, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 and 36 h after surgery, and also on swallowing during the first postoperative day.\n                Global VAS pain scores were lower in the groups treated with bupivacaine infiltration during the first 24 h after surgery (P < 0.05). Supplementary analgesic consumption was lower in group 3 than in group 2 during the 0-9 h interval immediately following surgery (P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences for any other parameters between the 3 groups.\n                These results suggest that the timing of peritonsillar infiltration with bupivacaine is not of clinical importance and does not affect the quality of postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing tonsillectomy.",

A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess shoulder pain severity whereas shoulder range of movement to the point of pain (SROMP) assessed passive range of movement and pain. Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) and Rankin Disability Index measured functional outcomes.\n                Ninety-eight subjects participated (49 strapped, 49 controls). Intention to treat analysis showed no significant difference in pain, range of movement or functional outcomes after the intervention phase or at the final assessment.

The presence of neglect or sensory loss, but not subluxation, at baseline was independently associated with poor outcome. Range of movement was lost early (mean difference SROMP between hemiplegic and contralateral shoulders at baseline = 15.2 degrees (95% CI 10.9-19.5)) and continued throughout the study. Shoulder strapping did not alter the rate at which range of movement was lost.\n                No significant benefit with shoulder strapping was demonstrated and reasons for this are discussed.

        "document": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains one of the most significant causes of death from an infectious agent. The rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and detection of rifampin (RIF) resistance are essential for early disease management. The GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay is a novel integrated diagnostic device for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and rapid detection of RIF resistance in clinical specimens. We determined the performance of the MTB/RIF assay for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and detection of rifampin resistance in smear-positive and smear-negative pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens obtained from possible tuberculosis patients. Two hundred fifty-three pulmonary and 176 extrapulmonary specimens obtained from 429 patients were included in the study. One hundred ten (89 culture positive and 21 culture negative for M. tuberculosis) of the 429 patients were considered to have tuberculosis. In pulmonary specimens, sensitivities were 100% (27/27) and 68.6% (24/35) for smear-positive and smear-negative specimens, respectively. It had a lower sensitivity with extrapulmonary specimens: 100% for smear-positive specimens (4/4) and 47.7% for smear-negative specimens (21/44). The test accurately detected the absence of tuberculosis in all 319 patients without tuberculosis studied. The MTB/RIF assay also detected 1 RIF-resistant specimen and 88 RIF-susceptible specimens, and the results were confirmed by drug susceptibility testing. We concluded that the MTB/RIF test is a simple method, and routine staff with minimal training can use the system. The test appeared to be as sensitive as culture with smear-positive specimens but less sensitive with smear-negative pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens that include low numbers of bacilli.",

        "document": "Much of the research on decision-making in health care has focused on consultation outcomes. Less is known about the process by which clinicians and patients come to a treatment decision. This study aimed to quantitatively describe the behaviour shown by doctors and patients during primary care consultations when three types of decision aids were used to promote treatment decision-making in a randomised controlled trial.\n                A video-based study set in an efficacy trial which compared the use of paper-based guidelines (control) with two forms of computer-based decision aids (implicit and explicit versions of DARTS II). Treatment decision concerned warfarin anti-coagulation to reduce the risk of stroke in older patients with atrial fibrillation. Twenty nine consultations were video-recorded. A ten-minute 'slice' of the consultation was sampled for detailed content analysis using existing interaction analysis protocols for verbal behaviour and ethological techniques for non-verbal behaviour.\n                Median consultation times (quartiles) differed significantly depending on the technology used. Paper-based guidelines took 21 (19-26) minutes to work through compared to 31 (16-41) minutes for the implicit tool; and 44 (39-55) minutes for the explicit tool. In the ten minutes immediately preceding the decision point, GPs dominated the conversation, accounting for 64% (58-66%) of all utterances and this trend was similar across all three arms of the trial. Information-giving was the most frequent activity for both GPs and patients, although GPs did this at twice the rate compared to patients and at higher rates in consultations involving computerised decision aids. GPs' language was highly technically focused and just 7% of their conversation was socio-emotional in content; this was half the socio-emotional content shown by patients (15%). However, frequent head nodding and a close mirroring in the direction of eye-gaze suggested that both parties were active participants in the conversation\n                Irrespective of the arm of the trial, both patients' and GPs' behaviour showed that they were reciprocally engaged in these consultations. However, even in consultations aimed at promoting shared decision-making, GPs' were verbally dominant, and they worked primarily as information providers for patients. In addition, computer-based decision aids significantly prolonged the consultations, particularly the later phases. These data suggest that decision aids may not lead to more 'sharing' in treatment decision-making and that, in their current form, they may take too long to negotiate for use in routine primary care.",

        "document": "Long-term use of the injectable contraceptive depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA, Depo-Provera) is associated with a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), particularly in the lumbar spine. The cause of DMPA-associated bone loss is not known, but the relative estrogen deficiency induced by DMPA use could be responsible. We have undertaken a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of oral estrogen replacement therapy in 38 premenopausal women (mean age 37) with a minimum 2 yr DMPA use who had a below average baseline lumbar spine BMD (T score < or = 0). Nineteen women were allocated to receive conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/d orally) and 19 to receive a matching placebo. All continued with regular DMPA injections throughout the study. Areal bone density was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total body sites every 6 months for 2 yr; the main outcome measure being the change in areal BMD at the lumbar spine. At baseline, the two groups were well matched for demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical variables, and for BMD. Twenty-seven subjects completed at least 18 months in the study, and 26 the full 2 yr, with similar numbers dropping out from each group (mainly for personal reasons). In the estrogen-treated group, mean lumbar spine BMD increased 1%, whereas in the placebo group it fell 2.6%, over 2 yr. The between group differences were 2.0% at 12 months (P = 0.058), 3.2% at 18 months (P < 0.01), and 3.5% at 24 months (P < 0.002). Differences of lesser statistical magnitude were seen at the femoral neck (between group differences at 2 yr: 2.7%, P = 0.24), Ward's triangle (5.0%, P = 0.055), greater trochanter (3.6%, P = 0.056), total body (1.3%, P = 0.046), legs (1.3%, P = 0.065), and trunk (2.0%, P = 0.029).

Subjects received placebo for 3 weeks, and then were randomized to 120 mg/day propranolol or 150 mg/day metoprolol with the use of a crossover design. Blood flow in the calf was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography at rest and immediately after exercise on a bicycle ergometer at a low and a high workload. The symptoms of claudication were monitored during bicycle exercise and by patient diaries maintained between visits. Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced an equivalent amount by metoprolol (19 beats/min) and propranolol (16 beats/min). Mean arterial pressure was reduced by propranolol at rest and by both drugs with exercise. Calf blood flow was not affected by either drug compared with placebo at rest or at either workload.

        "title": "A long-term study of policosanol in the treatment of intermittent claudication.",
        "document": "Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects. This study was undertaken to investigate the long-term effects of policosanol administered to patients with moderately severe intermittent claudication. The study consisted of a 6-week single-blind, placebo-controlled run in phase, followed by a 2-year double-blind, randomized treatment step. Fifty-six patients who met study entry criteria were randomized to receive placebo or policosanol 10 mg twice daily. Walking distances on a treadmill (constant speed 3.2 km/h, slope 10 degrees, temperature 25 degrees C) were assessed before and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of treatment. Both groups were similar at randomization. After 6 months of therapy, policosanol significantly increased (p < 0.01) the initial claudication distance from 125.9 +/- 8.7 m to 201.1 +/- 24.8 m and the absolute claudication distance from 219.5 +/- 14.1 m to 380.7 +/- 50.2 m. Both variables remained unchanged in the placebo group (p < 0.01). These effects did not wear off but improved after long-term therapy, so that final values were 333.5 +/- 28.6 m (initial claudication distance) and 648.9 +/- 54.1 m (absolute claudication distance); both significantly greater (p < 0.0001) than those obtained in the placebo group, which showed values of 137.9 +/- 21.8 m (initial claudication distance) and 237.7 +/- 28.1 m (absolute claudication distance), respectively. At study completion, 21 policosanol and 5 placebo patients attained increases in claudication distance values > 50% (p < 0.001). Policosanol, but not placebo, significantly increased the ankle/arm pressure index. In addition, from month 6 up to study completion, the frequency of patients reporting improvement of lower limb symptoms was greater in the policosanol group than in the placebo group. The treatment was tolerated well. There were 16 withdrawals (12 placebo, 4 policosanol) from the study. Eight patients in the placebo group experienced a total of 10 serious adverse events, 8 of which were vascular events, compared with none in the policosanol group (p < 0.01). In addition, 3 patients in the policosanol group and 3 patients in the placebo group reported mild adverse events during the study. The present results demonstrate the long-term usefulness of policosanol therapy to treat patients with intermittent claudication.",

        "title": "Changes in condyle position after bilateral vertical ramus osteotomy with and without osteosynthesis.",
        "document": "The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the importance of ramal osteosynthesis and evaluate postoperative condylar movements. The right temporomandibular joints of 53 patients with mandibular prognathism were examined by linear tomography the day before, 1 week after, and 1 year after surgery. During surgery the patients were randomly allocated to two groups: one with (n = 26) and one without (n = 27) osteosynthesis. It was found that osteosynthesis did not influence condyle position (p greater than 0.3). The two groups were thereafter pooled. Radiographic measurements of the posterior and anterior interarticular space revealed that condyle position 1 week postoperatively was forward and downward in relation to the preoperative position (posterior fossa, p less than 0.001; anterior fossa, p less than 0.01). One year later the condyle position demonstrated a tendency to approximate the preoperative position, especially with respect to the posterior part, but there was still a significant (p less than 0.01) difference when related to the original position. In conclusion, osteosynthesis after ramus osteotomy seems to be of no importance when healing and postoperative condyle position are considered. Furthermore, 1 year after surgery the condyles were not reestablished in their preoperative positions.",

        "document": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection in adults is often symptomatic and disabling. The present article summarizes our experience with phase 2 studies of an inactivated hepatitis A virus vaccine. Pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis with immune globulin (IG) is only effective for 4-6 months. We compared the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single i.m. injection of IG with single and booster doses of an inactivated hepatitis A virus vaccine (iHAV) in adults. A total of 75 healthy volunteers (aged 18-50 years) were evaluated in two separate studies. The first included 15 volunteers who received 25 units iHAV i.m. at 0 and 24 weeks. The second, a randomly controlled study, consisted of three groups receiving 25 units iHAV i.m. at 0, 1, and 6 months, or at 0, 2, and 6 months, or 0.06 ml/kg IG i.m. given once. Anti-HAV seroconversion was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). After IG injection, anti-HAV seroconversion occurred in 100% of recipients at week 1, declining to 10% at week 12, and 0% by week 20. In contrast, after a single 25-unit dose, RIA seropositivity in iHAV vaccines was 73% by week 2, reaching 100% by week 5, and persisted in all up to week 24, at which time anti-HAV geometric mean titers (GMT) were 2-fold higher than those seen at week 1 after IG. Administration of a booster dose given 1 or 2 months after primary immunization did not significantly improve the quantitative anti-HAV response at 6 months as compared to the effect of the primary dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This study compares caudal block using bupivacaine/ketamine with dorsal nerve block of the penis.\n                Sixty boys undergoing elective circumcision were given either 0.5 ml x kg-1 of bupivacaine 0.15% with ketamine 0.5 mg x kg-1 (n = 30) or dorsal nerve block of the penis with bupivacaine 0.5% (n = 30) as a supplement to general anaesthesia. Postoperative pain was assessed by parents using a modified objective pain score, and the time taken to first requirement of analgesia was recorded. Motor weakness, time to first micturition, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), eating habits, sleep disturbance and behaviour were also assessed.\n                There was no difference between the groups in time to first requirement for analgesia or number of doses of paracetamol given in the first 24 h. Almost half the boys in the caudal group had motor weakness, and there was a significant increase in time to first micturition in that group. There was no difference between the groups in PONV, eating, sleeping or behavioural disturbance.\n                Caudal anaesthesia with bupivacaine/ketamine does not confer any advantage over a dorsal nerve block with the doses used in this study. Because of the higher incidence of side-effects and technique failure in the caudal group, dorsal nerve block is perhaps the preferred technique.",

        "document": "The efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler compared with placebo, budesonide and formoterol were evaluated in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In a 12-month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 812 adults (mean age 64 yrs, mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 36% predicted normal), patients received two inhalations twice daily of either budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort) 160/4.5 microg (delivered dose), budesonide 200 microg (metered dose), formoterol 4.5 microg or placebo. Severe exacerbations and FEV1 (primary variables), peak expiratory flow (PEF), COPD symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQL), mild exacerbations, use of reliever beta2-agonist and safety variables were recorded. Budesonide/formoterol reduced the mean number of severe exacerbations per patient per year by 24% versus placebo and 23% versus formoterol. FEV1 increased by 15% versus placebo and 9% versus budesonide. Morning PEF improved significantly on day 1 versus placebo and budesonide; after 1 week, morning PEF was improved versus placebo, budesonide and formoterol. Improvements in morning and evening PEF versus comparators were maintained over 12 months. Budesonide/formoterol decreased all symptom scores and use of reliever beta2-agonists significantly versus placebo and budesonide, and improved HRQL versus placebo. All treatments were well tolerated. These results suggest a role for budesonide/formoterol in the long-term management of moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

The agents were injected into the cysts through stereotactically inserted silicone tubes. Follow-up was done for a minimum of 6 months. Outcome was based on a comparison of the volume of cysts before treatment and at follow-up. The index and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) of the cystic fluids, blood and cerebrospinal fluids and the endocrine function of these patients were determined before and after therapy.\n                19 patients finished the whole therapeutic course: 5 from group A, 9 from group B and 5 from group C. Four tumors in group A were polycystic, and the drug was selectively injected into the largest cyst. At follow-up, the volumes of the cysts in groups A and B regressed from 92 to 0%, while the drug-free cysts enlarged. In group B, 6 cysts almost disappeared and another 3 regressed from 78 to 57%. In group C, one cyst progressed and the others shrank by different degrees, but none disappeared completely or nearly. All patients in groups A and B had fever of different degrees, which resolved spontaneously in 8-24 h. The complications in group B included hyponatremia in 1 patient, and both adephagia obesity and cerebral infarction in 2 patients (1 of whom died after 6 months). Apart from the oculomotor paralysis occurring in 1 patient, the remainder of group C had no other severe complications. Blood chemistry, liver, kidney, pituitary and endocrinal functions changed little during the course in all these 19 patients. LD and its isoenzymes from the cystic fluids, CSF and serum showed no marked change after bleomycin injection.\n                Bleomycin injected into cysts of craniopharyngiomas causes the tumor to shrink. When (32)P is added, the therapeutic effect seems better than treatment with either (32)P or bleomycin alone. Blood chemistry, liver, kidney and endocrine functions change little irrespective of the therapy applied. However, the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy may severely disturb both serum electrolytes and endocrine function. LD and its isoenzymes in the cystic fluids, CSF and serum may not change after bleomycin treatment.\n                Copyright 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel",

In self-ratings and expert ratings concerning attitudes towards eating, eating behavior, and general psychopathology, significant improvements over time were observed in both groups. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), however, there were no statistically significant \"group by time\" differences. Results show that the intensive inpatient-care and psychotherapy program was highly effective in changing eating behavior and attitudes as well as general psychopathology. Fluoxetine showed a significant reduction in body weight, especially during the first three weeks of fluoxetine treatment. It was not possible to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in eating attitudes, eating behavior, and general psychopathology beyond that elicited by intensive inpatient psychotherapy and general inpatient care.

We aimed to assess its role in the context of current neonatal intensive care.\n                A randomized controlled trial, with sequential analysis of matched pairs of infants. Matching was undertaken by stratified randomization from 15 groups divided according to gestational age, oxygen requirement, and whether patients were intubated at 4 hours of age.\n                Two neonatal intensive care units.\n                Two hundred forty-four patients (birth weight 1.53 +/- 0.69 kg (mean +/- SD); gestational age 30.4 +/- 3.5 weeks) with respiratory failure.\n                Patients were randomized at 4 hours of age to receive either standard neonatal intensive care, or standard care plus continuous negative extrathoracic pressure (CNEP, -4 to -6 cmH2O) applied within a purpose-designed neonatal incubator. OUTCOME SCORES: Clinical scores were calculated for each infant at 56 days of age, or death if earlier. Scores included measures for mortality, respiratory outcome, the presence of cerebral ultrasound abnormalities, patent arterial duct, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy. The treatment given for the higher score for each pair was recorded and the cumulative net number of pairs favoring CNEP plotted in the sequential analysis to provide an ethical early termination strategy. Individual components of the outcome score and other secondary measurements were analyzed on completion of the trial.\n                The sequential analysis reached a decision boundary after 122 out of a possible maximum of 124 pairs were completed. The overall outcome score showed an overall significant benefit for CNEP. Secondary analysis showed that the use of CNEP was associated with an increase in mortality, cranial ultrasound abnormalities, and pneumothoraces, which were not statistically significant. However, 5% fewer patients were intubated (95% confidence interval [CI], 0-10), and the total duration of oxygen therapy among surviving infants at 56 days was lower (20.5 days, compared with 38.9 in controls; difference 18.4 days, 95% CI 3.8 to 33.0). Among all infants, the mean total duration of oxygen therapy was 18.3 days among CNEP-treated infants compared with 33.6 days among the controls (difference -15.3 days, 95% CI -0.2 to -30.4). This reduction in mean levels is entirely attributable to substantially fewer patients requiring prolonged oxygen therapy, the median duration of treatment being very similar in the two groups. As a result, commensurately fewer surviving infants showed chronic lung disease of prematurity.\n                The use of continuous negative pressure improves the respiratory outcome for neonates with respiratory failure.",

        "document": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of perioperative rifampin-trimethoprim was undertaken at the Hospital for Sick Children from March 1984 to October 1987, in which 243 patients undergoing 300 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures were randomized into groups including treatment with rifampin/trimethoprim and placebo, and then followed for a minimum of 2 years. Patients were stratified prior to randomization into those with and those without meningo-myeloceles having first insertions of their shunts, and those having revisions. Patients could be entered into the study more than once, but always received the same treatment regimen once allocation had taken place. Among the patients receiving antibiotics there was an infection rate of 12%, versus 19% among patients receiving placebo. Among the surgical procedures, the rates were 9% and 15%, respectively. Because these rates of infection were a substantial increase over the rate of 7.5% overall for the few years prior to implementation of the study, and well over any acceptable rate of infection, the study was stopped before statistical significance was reached. However, had the study continued, and the proportions of patients becoming infected remained constant, we would have been able to achieve a statistically significant difference in rates of infection, and therefore demonstrate a benefit of rifampin/trimethoprim as prophylaxis against shunt infection. Methodological problems encountered in this and other studies of prevention of CSF shunt infection will be discussed.",

We investigated whether treatment with an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) would delay or prevent the occurrence of microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria.\n                In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trial, we assigned 4447 patients with type 2 diabetes to receive olmesartan (at a dose of 40 mg once daily) or placebo for a median of 3.2 years. Additional antihypertensive drugs (except angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or ARBs) were used as needed to lower blood pressure to less than 130/80 mm Hg. The primary outcome was the time to the first onset of microalbuminuria. The times to the onset of renal and cardiovascular events were analyzed as secondary end points.\n                The target blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg) was achieved in nearly 80% of the patients taking olmesartan and 71% taking placebo; blood pressure measured in the clinic was lower by 3.1/1.9 mm Hg in the olmesartan group than in the placebo group. Microalbuminuria developed in 8.2% of the patients in the olmesartan group (178 of 2160 patients who could be evaluated) and 9.8% in the placebo group (210 of 2139); the time to the onset of microalbuminuria was increased by 23% with olmesartan (hazard ratio for onset of microalbuminuria, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.94; P=0.01). The serum creatinine level doubled in 1% of the patients in each group. Slightly fewer patients in the olmesartan group than in the placebo group had nonfatal cardiovascular events--81 of 2232 patients (3.6%) as compared with 91 of 2215 patients (4.1%) (P=0.37)--but a greater number had fatal cardiovascular events--15 patients (0.7%) as compared with 3 patients (0.1%) (P=0.01), a difference that was attributable in part to a higher rate of death from cardiovascular causes in the olmesartan group than in the placebo group among patients with preexisting coronary heart disease (11 of 564 patients [2.0%] vs. 1 of 540 [0.2%], P=0.02).\n                Olmesartan was associated with a delayed onset of microalbuminuria, even though blood-pressure control in both groups was excellent according to current standards.

This study assesses the effects of alterations in dietary salt consumption on the clinical severity of asthma in adult male asthmatic patients.\n                A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design was employed. Twenty seven mild to moderate asthmatic patients were established on a low sodium diet (80 mmol/day) at the end of a 4-5 day run in period and then randomised to receive 200 mmol/day slow sodium or matching placebo for five weeks, crossing over to the alternative regime for a further five weeks. Patients used diary cards to record twice daily peak expiratory flow rates, daily symptom scores, and bronchodilator consumption. Spirometry and degree of bronchial responsiveness (methacholine challenge test) were measured at screening and at the end of each treatment period. Twenty four hour urinary sodium excretion was measured at screening and in duplicate for each treatment period.\n                Twenty two patients completed the study. For these patients the mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) difference in 24 hour sodium excretion between treatments was 204 (175 to 235) mmol. Compared with placebo, sodium supplementation resulted in deleterious alterations of all measured parameters. Bronchial reactivity rose on slow sodium with a 0.73 (0.2 to 1.3) doubling dose methacholine difference compared with placebo. Estimated median (95% CI) difference in bronchodilator consumption was 1.3 (0.4 to 2.1) puffs per day, the estimated median difference in symptom score was 0.6 (0.2 to 0.9), and mean forced expiratory volume in one second fell by 0.21 (0.05 to 0.37) 1. The peak expiratory flow rate rose on placebo and fell on slow sodium. Median differences between treatments were 5.6% (2.2% to 9.8%) for morning and 7.8% (3.9% to 12.9%) for evening peak expiratory flow rate.\n                Our results suggest that large increases in dietary sodium result in physiological deterioration and increased morbidity in male asthmatic patients.",

The weekly prevalence of pain was reduced on acyclovir by the fourth week, with a reduction in the monthly prevalence of chronic pain in the second and third months and a reduction in associated local neurological symptoms between months 3-6. Total analgesic use in the first 4 weeks was reduced by acyclovir, but during follow up there was no difference in the prevalence of analgesic use between groups.

Observed toxicity included acceptable skin reactions secondary to radiotherapy and reversible leukopenia and thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy. Radiotherapy used alone or in combination with a nitrosourea significantly improved survival in comparison with semustine alone. The group receiving carmustine plus radiotherapy had the best survival, but the difference in survival between the groups receiving carmustine plus radiotherapy and semustine plus radiotherapy was not statistically significant. The combination of carmustine plus radiotherapy produced a modest benefit in long-term (18-month) survival as compared with radiotherapy alone, although the difference between survival curves was not significiant at the 0.05 level. This study suggests that it is best to use radiotherapy in the post-surgical treatment of malignant glioma and to continue the search for an effective chemotherapeutic regimen to use in addition to radiotherapy.",

Levetiracetam (LEV) is a newer antiepileptic drug (AED) with fewer SEs and essentially no drug interactions. We performed a pilot study testing the safety and feasibility of switching patients from PHT to LEV monotherapy for postoperative control of glioma-related seizures. Over a 13-month period, 29 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to initiate LEV therapy within 24 h of surgery or to continue PHT therapy. 6 month follow-up data were available for 15 patients taking LEV and for 8 patients taking PHT. In the LEV group, 13 patients (87%) were seizure-free. In the PHT group, 6 patients (75%) were seizure-free. Reported SEs at 6 months was as follows (%LEV/%PHT group): dizziness (0/14), difficulty with coordination (0/29), depression (7/14) lack of energy or strength (20/43), insomnia (40/43), mood instability (7/0). The pilot data presented here suggest that it is safe to switch patients from PHT to LEV monotherapy following craniotomy for supratentorial glioma. A large-scale, double-blinded, randomized control trial of LEV versus PHT is required to determine seizure control equivalence and better assess differences in SEs.",

        "document": "Cocaine abusers frequently report taking the drug in association with alcohol. This combined intake leads to the synthesis of cocaethylene, an active metabolite with effects similar to those of cocaine, but more prolonged. Since pharmacological effects of cocaethylene may partially account for the habit of cocaine abusers to take the drug in combination with ethanol, a main therapeutic goal in these patients should be making body fluids negative for cocaethylene. This randomized controlled open study conducted on 12 subjects co-abusers of cocaine and alcohol, evaluates the efficacy of a 12-week pharmacological treatment with Disulfiram (DIS) 400mg daily or Naltrexone (NTX) 50mg daily associated with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), as compared to CBT alone, in terms of: (i) stay in treatment; (ii) drug-free urinalyses for cocaine and cocaethylene; (iii) reduction of alcohol and cocaine craving. Data presented in this study are restricted to the first 4 weeks of treatment when all the enrolled subjects were still available for examination. In fact, of the 12 subjects enrolled in the study only 4 (33%) completed the 12-week treatment. Of these, three were in the CBT group and one in the NTX/CBT group. Results show that CBT treated subjects remained in treatment longer than those assigned to either DIS/CBT or NTX/CBT therapies. However, during the first 4 weeks of treatment, CBT-group urine tested positive almost always for both cocaine and cocaethylene. In contrast, both DIS/CBT and NTX/CBT treatments were associated to a statistically significant reduction, of positive urinalysis for both cocaine and cocaethylene, with respect to CBT alone. Moreover, across the first 4 weeks of treatment DIS/CBT and NTX/CBT treated subjects maintained lower scores at Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for both cocaine and alcohol craving than subjects receiving CBT alone. This pilot study suggests that the transient efficacy of pharmacological treatments in maintaining subjects drug free, does not add to the capability of CBT to retain them in treatment.",

Fifty-three women were enrolled in the study. Thirteen patients received 20 microg ethinylestradiol/150 microg desogestrel, 15 women were treated with 20 microg ethinylestradiol/75 microg gestodene, 11 with 30 microg ethinylestradiol/150 microg desogestrel and 14 with 30 microg ethinylestradiol/75 microg gestodene. Blood samples for estimation of serum resistin and insulin levels were drawn before administration of oral contraceptive and after 6 cycles of therapy. We found that serum resistin level remained unchanged in women receiving ethinylestradiol/desogestrel and was reduced in women treated with formulations containing gestodene. We conclude that ethinylestradiol combined with desogestrel or gestodene is unlikely to induce insulin resistance through resistin pathway.\n                Copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc.",

        "document": "The efficacy of remacemide hydrochloride (REM) as an antiepileptic drug (AED) was tested in a double-blind, add-on trial in patients with refractory epilepsy. Concurrent drugs included carbamazepine (CBZ). The interfering effects of the pharmacokinetic interaction between REM and CBZ were offset by the monitoring of plasma CBZ concentration and the appropriate reduction of CBZ dose by an unblinded observer.\n                Patients taking CBZ entered a 4-week run-in period to stabilise their dosage regimen to Tegretol tablets and blinded capsules containing Tegretol tablets. They then entered an 8-week baseline period during which variation of plasma CBZ concentration was used to derive an individual Shewart Control Chart for each patient. These charts were used to define the threshold for CBZ dose reduction after the addition of trial drug. Where necessary the unblinded observer adjusted that portion of the daily dose of CBZ concealed in the opaque capsules, thereby maintaining the blind for the investigator and the patient.\n                CBZ dosage reductions ranging from 14 to 50% were required by 63% of patients who received REM. Substantial increases in plasma CBZ concentration, which would have confounded the results of the trial, were thus avoided. The small increases in CBZ concentration that occurred in spite of this procedure were of similar magnitude in responders (patients who experienced > or =50% reduction in seizure frequency during treatment) and nonresponders, and in both groups the mean increase was <1 mg/L.\n                The method is offered as a model solution for problems caused by pharmacokinetic interactions in add-on trials.",

Patients were studied about every two months; those remaining in the blind phase at two years underwent repeat liver biopsy and were then placed on open-label colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily). With a few exceptions, the results in patients with early disease were similar to those in patients with advanced disease; hence, data on patients in all stages were combined in the main analysis. During the two-year study period the colchicine-treated patients, as compared with the placebo-treated patients, had improvement in levels of serum albumin, serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, and aminotransferases. However, there was no such improvement in the severity of symptoms or physical findings; moreover, there was no significant difference in the histologic changes noted at liver biopsy in the two treatment groups. At four years after entry, the cumulative mortality from liver disease was 21 percent in patients given colchicine and 47 percent in those given placebo (P = 0.05). The only side effect of colchicine was diarrhea, noted in three patients. The consistent and significant improvement in a number of markers of liver disease and the apparent decreased mortality from liver disease suggest that colchicine may provide some long-term clinical benefit in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, the failure of colchicine to reduce hepatic inflammation and fibrosis leaves uncertain the effect of the drug on the longterm outcome of this disease.",

Blood levels of uric acid, creatinine, phosphorus, calcium, lactate dehydrogenase and complete blood count were measured daily during rasburicase treatment and on days 6, 7 and 12. Initial uric acid level decreased significantly by 4 hours (from 343 micromol/L to 58 micromol/L, p<0.001), except for one steroid-resistant patient who required hemodialysis on day 14 after having introduced combined cytostatic treatment. Comparing the data of a subgroup of 12 patients receiving rasburicase with that of a historic cohort of 14 patients treated with allopurinol indicated the superiority of rasburicase over allopurinol in prophylaxis and treatment of hyperuricemia in children with leukemia and lymphoma.",

One thousand and one patients attending a general diabetic outpatient clinic at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital underwent screening using the Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, the biothesiometer, and palpation of pedal pulses. Two hundred and fifty-nine patients who were found to have a deficit on at least one of these tests were given a second appointment where the tests were repeated. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients attended for their second appointment. The expected range of variation in readings for the biothesiometer was 5 log hertz, sufficient variation to make the biothesiometer unacceptable as a screening instrument. The range of reproducibility for the four pedal pulses was from 68% to 81%, also an unacceptable level of variation. Over 85% of the results for the Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were the same on the first and second measurement. Of the three instruments examined in this study, only the Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments have sufficient reproducibility in the clinical setting for them to be recommended for general use as a screening test for risk of diabetic foot complications.",

Thus, 23 stable prepubertal pediatric kidney recipients, aged 10 +/- 3 years, with a mean transplant time of 3.4 +/- 2.5 years and histological findings of normal bone formation and adynamic bone on bone biopsies were prospectively randomized into two groups. These comprised a treated group that received 12 months of growth hormone and a control group that did not receive any treatment. Anthropometric measurements and blood for serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), osteocalcin, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were obtained every 3 months. Measurements of bone mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were performed at the beginning and end of the study period. All patients underwent an initial and final bone biopsy procedure after double tetracycline labeling. Annual growth velocity increased and standard deviation scores for height improved in the treated group. Serum IGF-I levels increased in the treated group and the increase was evident in patients with normal bone formation who received growth hormone but not in patients with adynamic bone. Serum calcium, phosphorus, osteocalcin, and PTH levels did not differ between the treated and control groups. Bone mass did not change in the treated group, but declined after 12 months in the control group. Bone formation rates did not increase with growth hormone treatment. Thus, growth hormone therapy improves linear growth and maintains bone mass, but does not favorably affect bone formation rates in stable pediatric renal allograft recipients.",

        "document": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of a musical presentation of social story information on the behaviors of students with autism. Social stories are a means of incorporating an individual with autism's propensity toward visual learning with educationally necessary behavior modifications. Participants in the study were four first- and second-grade students with a primary diagnosis of autism attending an elementary school in eastern Iowa. A unique social story was created for each student that addressed a current behavioral goal. Subsequently, original music was composed using the text of the social story as lyrics. The independent variable for this study was one of three treatment conditions: baseline (A); reading the story (B); and singing the story (C). The reading and singing versions of the social stories were alternately presented to the students using the counterbalanced treatment order ABAC/ACAB. The dependent variable was the frequency with which the target behavior occurred under each condition of the independent variable. Data were collected for a period of 1 hour following presentation of the social story. Results from all four cases indicated that both the reading condition (B) and the singing condition (C) were significantly (p <.05) more effective in reducing the target behavior than the no-contact control condition (A). The singing condition was significantly more effective than the reading condition only in Case Study III. For the remaining case studies, the mean frequency of the target behavior was smaller during the singing condition, but not significantly so. These results suggested that the use of a musically adapted version of social stories is an effective and viable treatment option for modifying behaviors with this population.",

Because arterial chemotherapy regimens targeted to the liver have demonstrated high response rates, an intergroup trial of adjuvant therapy for patients undergoing hepatic resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer was initiated.\n                Patients with one to three potentially resectable metastases were randomized preoperatively to receive no further therapy (control arm, 56 patients) or postoperative hepatic arterial floxuridine combined with intravenous continuous-infusion fluorouracil (chemotherapy arm, 53 patients). After exclusion of patients identified as ineligible for the planned treatment at the time of surgery, there were 45 control patients and 30 on the chemotherapy arm. The study was powered to evaluate improvement in time to recurrence and hepatic disease-free survival, not overall survival.\n                The 4-year recurrence-free rate was 25% for the control arm and 46% for the chemotherapy group (P =.04). The 4-year liver recurrence-free rate was 43% in the control group and 67% in the chemotherapy group (P =.03). The median survival of the 75 assessable patients was 49 months for the control arm and 63.7 months for the chemotherapy arm (P =.60). The median survival of all 109 patients was 47 months for the control arm compared with 34 months for the chemotherapy arm (P =.19)\n                These data demonstrate that adjuvant intra-arterial and intravenous chemotherapy was beneficial in prolonging time to recurrence and pre-venting hepatic recurrence after hepatic resection of colorectal cancer.",

After multidisciplinary meetings and expert reviews, the patterns were addressed with educational initiatives, correction of systems issues, and/or intensive quality monitoring. Only 25% of complications and 42% of inpatient deaths were reported. A total of 75.2% of adverse events resulting in permanent disability or death were attributed to the nature of the disease. Interventions to improve reporting were largely unsuccessful.\n                We have developed a user-friendly Web-based system to track complications and identify patterns of adverse events. Underreporting of adverse events and attributing the complication to the nature of the disease represent a problem in reporting culture among surgeons at our institution. Similar systems should be used by surgery departments, particularly those affiliated with teaching hospitals, to identify quality improvement opportunities.",

Questionnaire data were collected at enrollment, immediately following the intervention, at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. At 1 year, 25 women remained in the study. More women in the intervention group were not pregnant and still using contraception, and were able to successfully switch contraceptive methods compared to women in the control group. There was no decrease in repeat pregnancy in the intervention group at 1 year compared to the control group. Our intervention resulted in a sustained increase in knowledge of OCs throughout the study period. However, more is needed to promote postpartum contraceptive compliance and decrease repeat pregnancies in young, low-income African Americans with unintended pregnancies.",

Ten non-diabetic pregnant women served as controls for the variations in the metabolic parameters considered (24-hour mean blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin). Strict glycaemic control was achieved and maintained by both regimens before week 13 in all patients with type I and in 57.1% of patients with type II diabetes. The mean insulin requirements in the type I group increased up to week 34-36 and then stabilized to term in patients receiving CSII and rose progressively to term in those receiving ICT. In the type II group insulin requirements rose up to week 36 in patients receiving CSII and up to week 32 in those receiving ICT, stabilizing thereafter on both regimens. No significant differences in mean insulin requirement at the different stages of gestation were found between the patients receiving CSII and those receiving ICT of either group. Perinatal outcome was satisfactory in both groups, although control of foetal growth was better with ICT than with CSII. CSII is a practical, safe and effective method of maintaining maternal normoglycemia in pregnancy but for the present we cannot consider it superior to ICT in the treatment of pregnant diabetic women.",

        "document": "A total of 161 previously untreated patients with FIGO stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer were randomised after surgery to receive six courses of either carboplatin 400 mg m-2 alone (Arm A) or carboplatin 300 mg m-2 with chlorambucil 10 mg day-1 for 7 days (Arm B). The median progression free survival (PFS) was similar: arm A: 45 weeks; arm B: 61 weeks (P = 0.830). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the extent of residual disease and performance status were the most important prognostic factors for PFS. Fifty-two per cent of patients received dose escalations based on nadir blood counts, and 89% of all dose adjustments were made according to protocol. Failure to achieve a significant degree of leucopenia was associated with worse progression free survival (P less than 0.001). A total of 29.4% of patients fall into this category. The median survival was similar in both arms, i.e. 75 weeks. It is unlikely that there is any major clinical advantage to adding chlorambucil to single agent carboplatin for the management of advanced ovarian cancer, but whether used in combination or a single agent, the dose of carboplatin should be sufficient to cause at least grade I leucopenia. This may best be achieved by determining the initial dose based on renal function, and then adjusting subsequent doses according to nadir blood counts.",

The current study addresses the question whether monotherapy with the new broad-spectrum carbapenem meropenem exhibits efficacy comparable to that of the standard combination therapy with ceftazidime and amikacin for empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic patients. Seventy-one patients with hematological malignancies (55%) or solid tumors (45%), neutropenia < 500/microliter, and fever > 38.5 degrees C were randomly assigned to either meropenem (1 g every 8 h) or ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h) and amikacin (15 mg/kg/day) intravenously. Meropenem (n = 34) and ceftazidime/amikacin (n = 37) were equivalent with respect to the clinical response at 72 h (62% versus 68%) (p > 0.05) and at the end of unmodified therapy (59% versus 62%). Gram-positive bacteremia responded poorly in the meropenem and ceftazidime/amikacin group (29% versus 25%), whereas all gram-negative bacteremias responded except for one in the meropenem group caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All patients survived to 72 h. One patient in each group died of gram-positive sepsis resistant to study medication. No significant side effects occurred in any regimen. This study suggests that meropenem monotherapy might be as effective as combination therapy with ceftazidime and amikacin for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic patients.",

ANP preserves glomerular filtration rate or RBF (or both) in severe animal models of acute renal failure. Radiocontrast is known to substantially decrease RBF and can induce acute renal failure. Twenty consecutive patients with chronic renal failure (60% with diabetes) were randomized in a prospective, double-blind fashion to receive either ANP (50 micrograms bolus, then 1 microgram/min infusion) or mannitol (15% at 100 ml/hr) for 2 hours before and during cardiac catheterization with diatrizoate. Baseline serum creatinine level (ANP 2.4 +/- 0.7 mg/dl, mannitol 2.5 +/- 0.8 mg/dl), medications, and quantity of radiocontrast were similar in both groups. Direct measurements of RBF were made with thermodilution catheters placed in the left renal vein. RBF rose significantly (p less than 0.05), to 198% of baseline at 15 minutes and 166% of baseline at 65 minutes in the group receiving ANP and remained stable in the group receiving mannitol. ANP levels rose significantly from baseline at 5, 15, 65 and 120 minutes in both groups (p less than 0.05). Acute renal failure defined as a 0.5 mg/dl rise of creatinine within 24 hours of cardiac catheterization, developed only in patients with diabetes mellitus and was similar in both experimental groups (ANP, 50%; mannitol, 30%). Only patients with diabetes mellitus responded with an increase in RBF after a 5-minute infusion of either ANP or mannitol (diabetes, 165% +/- 28% baseline; no diabetes, 96% +/- 8% baseline) (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, RBF was maintained or increased despite administration of radiocontrast, a documented renal vasoconstrictor. Patients with diabetes mellitus had a renal vasodilatory response to drug infusion. Acute renal failure occurred to a similar extent in both groups. Plasma ANP levels rose significantly in both groups. Mannitol may induce ANP release, thus contributing to mannitol's renal effects.",

Treatment was given as 30-min infusions of tobramycin in 0.9% saline. Primary outcome measure was change in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), over the 14 days of treatment, expressed as a percentage of the predicted normal value for age, sex, and height. We also measured the change in FEV1 expressed as a percentage of baseline. Secondary outcomes included change in serum creatinine. The study was powered for equivalence, and primary analysis was per protocol.\n                219 patients (107 once daily, 112 three-times daily) completed the study per protocol. None was lost to follow-up, although 20 discontinued intervention. Of 122 patients assigned to once daily treatment, three did not receive the study regimen. The mean change in FEV1 (% predicted) over 14 days was similar on the two regimens (10.4% [once daily] vs 10.0% [three-times daily]; adjusted mean difference 0.4% [95% CI -3.3 to 4.1]). Mean% change in FEV1 from baseline was also similar in both treatments (21.9% vs 22.1%; -0.1% [-8.0 to 7.9]).

The patients (n=144; age 64+/-7 yrs, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 44+/-11% pred) participated in a three-centre double-blind double-placebo parallel group study and were randomized after a run-in period of 2 weeks to receive either salmeterol 50 microg b.i.d., salmeterol 5 microg b.i.d. plus ipratropium 40 microg q.i.d. or placebo for a period of 12 weeks.

The combination of salmeterol plus ipratropium elicited a greater bronchodilator response (11% and 94% increases respectively) than salmeterol alone during the first 6 h after inhalation. During treatment there were significant improvements in daytime symptom scores and morning peak expiratory flow in both the salmeterol and the salmeterol plus ipratropium groups (p<0.001), with an associated decrease in the use of rescue salbutamol. Improvements in FEV1 and sGaw were greater in the salmeterol plus ipratropium group than in the patients receiving only salmeterol. Thirty-five patients had an exacerbation; 11 (23%) in the salmeterol group (versus placebo NS), six (13%) in the salmeterol plus ipratropium group (versus placebo p<0.01) and 18 (36%) in the placebo group. In conclusion, in patients with severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long-term treatment with either salmeterol alone or salmeterol plus ipratropium is safe and effective.

Feeding behavior was also assessed before and after circumcision by nursing observation.\n                Neonates in both groups showed significant increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, and crying during circumcision with no clinically significant differences observed between the groups. Postoperative comfort scores showed no significant differences between the groups until the 360-minute postoperative assessment, at which time the acetaminophen group had significantly improved scores (P < .05). Feeding behavior deteriorated in breast- and bottle-fed neonates in both groups, and acetaminophen did not seem to influence this deterioration.\n                This study confirms that circumcision of the newborn causes severe and persistent pain. Acetaminophen was not found to ameliorate either the intraoperative or the immediate postoperative pain of circumcision, although it seems that it may provide some benefit after the immediate postoperative period.",

Two hundred adult patients immediately after myocardial revascularization were randomly assigned to a specific chest tube manipulation group. The dependent variables were drainage, incidence of cardiac tamponade, incidence of surgical reentry, hemodynamic values, and number of manipulation episodes. Statistical analyses revealed no difference in any of the dependent variables when milking and stripping were used. Of the 200 patients, 78 did not require any manipulation of the chest tubes in the first 8 hours after surgery. One patient had signs of cardiac tamponade and six other patients required surgical reentry. Positioning of the connecting tube in a nondependent position assisted with the removal of drainage from the chest cavity. In conclusion, patients having myocardial revascularization did not need their chest tubes manipulated the first 8 hours after surgery. Visible drainage in the chest tube did not cause a lack of patency.",

        "document": "Observational studies have suggested that the prevalence of trachoma is lower in children with clean faces than in those with ocular or nasal discharge or flies on the face. We carried out a community-based randomised trial in three pairs of villages to assess the impact on trachoma of a face-washing intervention programme following a mass topical antibiotic treatment campaign. Six villages in Kongwa, Tanzania, were randomly assigned mass treatment plus the face-washing programme or treatment only. 1417 children aged 1-7 years in these villages were randomly selected and followed up for trachoma status and observations of facial cleanliness at baseline and 2, 6, and 12 months. At 12 months, children in the intervention villages were 60% more likely to have had clean faces at two or more follow-up visits than children in the control villages. The odds of having severe trachoma in the intervention villages were 0.62 (95% Cl 0.40-0.97) compared with control villages. A clean face at two or more follow-up visits was protective for any trachoma (odds ratio 0.58 [0.47-0.72]) and severe trachoma (0.35 [0.21-0.59]). This community-based participatory approach to face-washing intervention had variable penetration rates in the villages and was labour intensive. However, we found that, combined with topical treatment, community-based strategies for improving hygiene in children in trachoma-endemic villages can reduce the prevalence of trachoma.",

Patients were randomized to two groups-matched for sex, age, and medication status-and blinded to the comparison protocol. They were told the trial would last for 12 months, unless one protocol proved to be more efficacious. If so, groups would merge, and the group that received the less efficacious treatment would also be afforded 12 months of the more effective one. The study was conducted at Children's Hospital, San Diego, Calif. Patients were selected according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition-Revised (DSM-III-R) criteria and recruited by advertisements and referral. At baseline, Group 1 included 11 adults and 1 adolescent, and Group 2 included 10 adults. Group 1 employed a kundalini yoga meditation protocol and Group 2 employed the Relaxation Response plus Mindfulness Meditation technique. Baseline and 3-month interval testing was conducted using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised Obsessive Compulsive (SCL-90-R OC) and Global Severity Index (SCL-90-R GSI) scales, Profile of Moods scale (POMS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Purpose in Life (PIL) test. Seven adults in each group completed 3 months of therapy. At 3 months, Group 1 demonstrated greater improvements (Student's independent groups t-test) on the Y-BOCS, SCL-90-R OC and GSI scales, and POMS, and greater but nonsignificant improvements on the PSS and PIL test. An intent-to-treat analysis (Y-BOCS) for the baseline and 3-month tests showed that only Group 1 improved. Within-group statistics (Student's paired t-tests) showed that Group 1 significantly improved on all six scales, but Group 2 had no improvements. Groups were merged for an additional year using Group 1 techniques. At 15 months, the final group (N=11) improved 71%, 62%, 66%, 74%, 39%, and 23%, respectively, on the Y-BOCS, SCL-90-R OC, SCL-90-R GSI, POMS, PSS, and PIL; P<0.003 (analysis of variance).

Stem cell collection after HDCT1 was inefficient and delayed in patients who had received prior chemotherapy before HDCT1. The interval between HDCT1 and HDCT2 was shorter in SHG than in DHG (median 62.5 days vs 178.5 days, P-value=0.002). Hematologic recovery in HDCT2 was delayed compared to HDCT1. However, there was no difference in hematologic recovery between SHG and DHG. A high rate of treatment-related mortality (TRM) was recorded during HDCT2, but there was no evidence that the shorter interval caused a higher rate of TRM (P-value=0.454). The probability of disease-free survival at 2 years after HDCT2 in the SHG and DHG were 66.7 and 25.0%, respectively (P-value=0.031). Therefore, to administer the second HDCT earlier in double HDCT, and thus to improve the survival of patients with high-risk solid tumors, the single-harvest approach is recommended rather than the double-harvest approach.",

The incidence and prevalence of patients with multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae were assessed, and patient isolates were typed phenotypically and by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. All hospital hygiene measures implemented were recorded, and the influence of the restrictive policy on antibiotic use was analyzed. This policy consisted of a prior authorization requirement and the withdrawal of all antibiotics with a possible selective pressure on multiresistant strains (gentamicin, tobramycin, quinolones, cotrimoxazole, broad-spectrum penicillins, and cephalosporins). This ban left only carbapenems and amikacin for treatment. Typing showed that 17 of the 61 (28%) patients involved were infected or colonized with a single multiresistant strain of Klebsiella oxytoca, for which an environmental source was identified. The isolates recovered from the other patients comprised eight different species, and subsequent genotyping yielded a great variety of strains. The increased incidence could not be controlled with hospital hygiene measures alone. Only after implementation of the restrictive antibiotic policy did the epidemic strain vanish and the endemic incidence of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae decrease to <50% of the level before intervention. In the years since, the incidence has remained at this low level, and the antibiotic costs have decreased to a level lower than before intervention.",

Both groups were individually randomised into control group (n=25) and study group (n=25). The corresponding grade of ocular surface burn by Dua classification was noted. The eyes in the study group underwent amniotic membrane transplantation in addition to conventional medical therapy. In the control group, conventional medical therapy along with mechanical release of early adhesions as and when necessary was instituted. Rate of healing of corneal epithelial defect, visual acuity, extent of corneal vascularisation, corneal clarity and formation of symblepharon were compared in both groups.\n                In patients with moderate ocular burns treated with amniotic membrane transplantation, the rate of epithelial healing was significantly better than the group treated with standard medical therapy alone (p=0.0004). There was no overall difference in the final visual outcome, symblepharon formation, corneal clarity and vascularisation with or without amniotic membrane transplantation.\n                Amniotic membrane transplantation in eyes with acute ocular burns promotes faster healing of epithelial defect in patients with moderate grade burns. There seems to be no definite long-term advantage of amniotic membrane transplantation over medical therapy and mechanical release of adhesions in terms of final visual outcome, appearance of symblepharon and corneal vascularisation when compared in a controlled clinical setting.",

Outcome measures included the peri-operative outcome index, delayed union, revision surgery and symptoms beyond 16 weeks. CT was used to reconstruct an image of each affected clavicle and Photoshop 7.0 software employed to calculate the percentage of the clavicular cortical area in the sagittal plane. The patients were reviewed clinically and radiographically at four and 12 months after the operation. The superior plate group had a higher rate of delayed union and had more symptomatic patients than the 3D group (p < 0.05). The percentage comparisons of cortical bone area showed that cortical bone in the superior distal segment is thicker than in the inferior segment, it is also thicker in the anterior mid-section than in the posterior (p < 0.05). If fixation of midshaft fractures of the clavicle with a plate is indicated, a 3D reconstruction plate is better than one placed superiorly, because it is consistent with the stress distribution and shape of the clavicle.",

From July 1996 to July 1998, 61 patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer were treated at the Gynaecology Oncology Unit at the Royal North Shore of Sydney, Australia. Twenty-nine patients were treated with laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) and bilateral salpingo-oophrectomy (BSO) plus minus laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy (LPLA), while 32 patients were treated with the traditional laparotomy and underwent total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and BSO plus minus pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLA). The main outcomes studied were operative time, blood loss, blood transfusion, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, duration of hospital stay, and number of lymph nodes obtained. In conclusion, laparoscopic treatment of endometrial cancer is safe in the hands of experienced operators with minimal intraoperative and postoperative complications. This procedure is associated with significantly less blood loss and shorter hospitalization; however, it is associated with significantly longer operating time. Proper selection of patients for the laparoscopic procedure is the vital step in achieving the major goals of this approach.",

Two hundred and one patients with stage IIIb or IV NSCLC were randomly assigned to cisplatin 120 mg m-2 on days 1 and 29 and vindesine 3 mg m-2 weekly x 6 or to no chemotherapy. Both groups were eligible to receive radiotherapy or other palliative treatment as required. Of 188 evaluable patients, 97 received chemotherapy and 91 were in the control arm. Response was assessed between days 42 and 49. Responders continued chemotherapy at the same doses though cisplatin being given 6 weekly x 4 and the vindesine 2 weekly x 12. The overall response rate to chemotherapy was 28%; there were no significant differences according to major prognostic criteria.

Following program delivery and 1 year later, girls randomly assigned to the intervention arm improved more than girls in a control arm on variables associated with reduced risks for substance use, including communication with their mothers, knowledge of family rules about substance use, awareness of parental monitoring of their discretionary time, non-acceptance of peer substance use, problem-solving skills, and ability to refuse peer pressure to use substances. Relative to control-arm girls, those in the intervention arm also reported less 30-day use of alcohol and marijuana and lower intentions to smoke, drink, and take illicit drugs in the future. Girls' mothers in the intervention arm reported greater improvements after the program and relative to control-arm mothers in their communication with their daughters, establishment of family rules about substance use, and monitoring of their daughters' discretionary time. Study findings lend support to the potential of gender-specific, parent-involvement, and computerized approaches to preventing substance use among adolescent girls.",

Using a prospective randomized placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trial, a patient-controlled analgesia system was used to measure differences in outcome. Trials took place in a labour unit at the St. Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands, during a period of 18 months. Forty-six patients, during the first stage of labour, were treated with TENS, and 48 with a placebo apparatus. Main outcome measures were pain relief, amount of administered analgesics, obstetrical and neonatal outcome, and side effects. No significant differences occurred between groups in the number of requests for pethidine/promethazine. The foetal outcome in both groups was the same. TENS and placebo were considered equally effective by both patients and staff. In conclusion, TENS was not more effective than a placebo apparatus in relieving pain during the first stage of labour.

Before and 3 weeks after each set of injections, the cervical dystonia was \"blindly\" scored by the investigator. Each patient was also asked to independently score the improvement of the dystonia and neck pain. Four patients dropped out and one patient showed spontaneous remission. The remaining 18 patients completed the study and showed a significant improvement after the injections of botulinum toxin in comparison with that of the placebo. The effect started about 1 week after injection and the maximal effect lasted about 11 weeks in patients with a satisfactory response. The neck pain was satisfactorily relieved in 9 of 10 patients affected. There were no significant side effects. Thus, botulinum toxin injection is effective in treating cervical dystonias; injection of a higher dose of botulinum toxin in a greater number of neck muscles is required for those patients with complex cervical dystonia.",

The study was a prospective, randomized trial of 645 evaluable low-risk endometrial carcinoma patients from 6 European gynecologic cancer centers. All tumors were in FIGO stage IA-IB, of endometrioid histological type, and FIGO grade 1-2. High-dose-rate afterloading equipments (iridium [Ir] 192 or cobalt [co] 60) were used at 5 centers, and low-dose-rate (LDR) afterloading equipment (cesium [Cs] 137) at 1 center. Perspex vaginal applicators or ovoids were normally used, and the dose was specified at 5 mm from the surface of the applicator. Three to 6 fractions (3.0-8.0 Gy) were given, and the overall treatment time was 4 to 15 days. A total of 319 patients were treated with surgery plus vaginal irradiation (treatment group), and 326 patients with surgery alone (control group).Twenty-six recurrences (4.0%) were recorded in the complete series. The locoregional recurrence rate was 2.6%, whereas distant metastases occurred in 1.4%. The rate of vaginal recurrences was 1.2% in the treatment group versus 3.1% in the control group. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.114). Side effects were few and mild (grade 1-2). Dysuria, frequency, and incontinence were slightly more common after vaginal irradiation (2.8% vs 0.6%, respectively). Late intestinal problems were few and similar in the 2 groups. The conclusions were that the impact of postoperative brachytherapy on even the locoregional recurrence rate seems to be limited in patients with low-risk endometrial carcinoma.

Sleep variables, bruxism-related motor activity, and subjective reports (pain, comfort, oral salivation, and quality of sleep) were analyzed with analysis of variance and the Friedman test.\n                A significant reduction in the number of sleep bruxism episodes per hour (decrease of 42%, P < .001) was observed with the MOS.

As aggregating agents, arachidonic acid (500 micrograms/ml), adenosine di-phosphate (2 x 10(-5) M) and collagen (0.18 microgram/ml) were used. The mean maximal arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was 61%, 78% and 13% in the Salicis cortex extract, placebo and acetylsalicylate groups.

        "document": "The efficacy of albuterol in the management of infants with first-time wheezing is controversial. This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 128 Egyptian infants with first-time wheezing (mean age 5.9 months) who were randomly separated into four equivalent therapy groups: nebulized albuterol, nebulized saline solution, orally administered albuterol, and orally administered placebo. The nebulized therapy groups received two treatments 30 minutes apart; the oral therapy groups received one treatment. In addition, 41 infants with recurrent wheezing comprised an open-label control group who received two albuterol nebulizations. Chest radiographs, leukocyte counts, blood culture specimens, and nasal aspirate for viral antigen detection were obtained to confirm the clinical diagnosis of viral bronchiolitis. Respiratory and heart rates, clinical score, and oxygen saturation were recorded at baseline and 30 and 60 minutes after treatment. There was no difference among the four randomized groups in any of the outcomes except for an increase in heart rate of 10 beats/min in the nebulized albuterol group compared with a decrease in heart rate of 8 beats/min in the oral placebo group. No differences in the need for additional treatment were observed. Nebulized albuterol significantly improved the clinical score and reduced the respiratory rate of those with recurrent wheezing relative to those in the randomized groups. We conclude that nebulized albuterol is effective in the treatment of infants with recurrent wheezing, but there was no demonstrable efficacy of orally administered or nebulized albuterol in relieving the respiratory distress of infants with bronchiolitis in Egypt.",

Primary outcome measures: Pain severity and knee function score. Secondary outcome measures: Walking distance and quality of life. Analysis: Multiple linear regression models according to the intention-to-treat-principle were used to assess outcome differences for the entire group of patients. In addition, we performed explorative subgroup analyses on primary overall outcomes stratified for alignment, degree of OA, origin of OA, and age.\n                Although the primary outcome measures were improved in the intervention group in comparison with the controls at each assessment point, the differences reached only borderline significance. The reported walking distances at 3 months, 12 months and overall were significantly longer in the brace group (P=0.03, P=0.04 and P=0.02, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed a better effect in the varus group, in patients with severe OA, in patients with secondary OA and in patients younger then 60 years. In total 25 patients in the brace group and 14 in the control group changed their initial treatment, mostly (74%) because of a lack of beneficial effect.\n                The results indicate that a brace intended to reduce load shows small effects in patients with unicompartmental OA.

Safe and effective alternative treatments are required. Although a short-term benefit of cyclosporine in active Crohn's disease has been suggested, the long-term safety and efficacy of this treatment have not been established.\n                We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the effect of 18 months of low-dose cyclosporine treatment on the course of Crohn's disease. Adult patients whose disease had been active within the previous two years were randomly assigned to receive cyclosporine (151 patients) or placebo (154 patients) in addition to their usual therapy. Randomization was stratified according to center and score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (193 patients had scores of 150 or less, and 112 had scores greater than 150).

The study design allowed outpatients taking LMWH heparin to go home immediately and hospitalized patients taking LMWH to be discharged early. Patients treated with standard heparin or LMWH received the oral anticoagulant starting on the second day, and heparin was discontinued when the therapeutic range (INR 2-3) had been reached. Anticoagulant treatment was maintained for 3 months. Patients treated with SCHep were injected twice daily for 3 months without oral anticoagulants. Patients were evaluated for inclusion and follow-up with color duplex scanning. Venography was not used. In case of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) a ventilatory-perfusional lung scan was performed. Endpoints of the study were recurrent or extension of DVT, bleeding, the number of days spent in hospital, and costs of treatments. Of the 325 patients included, 294 completed the study. Dropouts totaled 31 (10.5%); six of the 325 included patients (1.8%) died from the related, neoplastic illness. Recurrence or extension of DVT was observed in 6.1% of patients in the LMWH group, in 6.2% in the standard heparin group, and in 7.1% in the SCHep group. Most recurrences (11/17) were in the first month in all groups. Bleedings were all minor, mostly during hospital stay. Hospital stay in patients treated with LMWH was 1.2+/-1.4 days in comparison with 5.4+/-1.2 in those treated with standard heparin. There was no hospital stay in the SCHep group. Average treatment costs in 3 months in the standard heparin group (US $2,760) were considered to be 100%; in comparison costs in the LMWH group was 28% of the standard heparin and 8% in the SCHep group.

The effects of each were compared during a 12-week, double-blind trial. Treatment with milrinone or digoxin significantly increased treadmill exercise time as compared with placebo (by 82 and 64 seconds respectively; 95 percent confidence limits, 44 and 123, and 30 and 100). Both treatments reduced the frequency of decompensation from heart failure, from 47 percent with placebo to 34 percent with milrinone (P less than 0.05; 95 percent confidence limits, 22 and 46) and 15 percent with digoxin (P less than 0.01; 95 percent confidence limits, 7 and 26). However, the clinical condition of 20 percent of the patients taking milrinone deteriorated within two weeks after treatment was begun, as compared with only 3 percent of those taking digoxin (P less than 0.05). The left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was not significantly changed by milrinone (+0.2 percent; 95 percent confidence limits, -1.5 and 1.9), but it was increased by digoxin (+1.7 percent; P less than 0.01; 95 percent confidence limits, -0.03 and 3.4) and decreased by placebo (-2.0 percent; 95 percent confidence limits, -3.8 and -0.1). Three-month survival was related inversely to the base-line ejection fraction. Analysis of mortality from all causes according to the intention to treat suggested an adverse effect of milrinone (P = 0.064). After adjustment for an excess of patients with lower ejection fractions randomly assigned to receive milrinone, this trend was not significant (P = 0.26). Increased ventricular arrhythmias occurred more frequently in patients who received milrinone than in those who did not (18 vs. 4 percent; P less than 0.03). We conclude that milrinone significantly increased exercise tolerance and reduced the frequency of worsened heart failure. However, in the population of patients studied, milrinone or the combination of milrinone and digoxin offered no advantage over digoxin alone. Furthermore, our data suggest that milrinone may aggravate ventricular arrhythmias.",

The two treatment groups, whose members were six to 70 years old, proved comparable on admission. There were eight deaths in the dexamethasone group and nine in the placebo group (no significant difference; P = 0.8); at post-mortem examination the brain showed features diagnostic of cerebral malaria in all but one patient who died. Dexamethasone prolonged coma among the survivors: the interval between the start of treatment and the full recovery of consciousness was 63.2 +/- 5.9 hours (mean +/- S.E.M.) in the dexamethasone group, as compared with 47.4 +/- 3.2 hours in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Complications, including pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding, occurred in 26 patients given dexamethasone and 11 given placebo (P = 0.004). Only five patients had neurologic sequelae. Results were similar in a subgroup of 28 children six to 14 years old. Dexamethasone is deleterious in cerebral malaria and should no longer be used.",

The treatment was given for 1 year and follow-up was for 2 years after stopping treatment. In both groups, recurrence of hyperthyroidism occurred, most commonly during the first 6 months (35% of HD and 44% of TD). By 2 years after stopping treatment, recurrence had occurred in 50% of the HD and 66% of the TD group. The differences were not significant. Thyroid antibodies, serum thyroglobulin and pertechnetate uptake fell similarly in both groups during treatment. Cigarette smoking was similar in both the groups and did not influence the frequency of relapse. In both HD and TD groups, when relapsing patients were examined according to whether they relapsed early (within 6 months or less) or late it was found that those who relapsed late were, in respect of goitre size, pertechnetate uptake and presence of detectable plasma TSH, similar to the patients who did not relapse at all. In conclusion, the changes in the measured variables and the progress of the patients was similar whether treated by the HD or TD regimen.",

        "document": "We examined the efficacy of decreasing high doses (beginning at 18 MU/day) of interferon-alpha 2a vs. that of daily low doses (3 MU) in the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus infection. Patients treated with 18 MU had a somewhat higher frequency of normalization of serum ALT levels than patients treated with low doses (31% and 12%, respectively, on an intention-to-treat basis). A decrease in the percentage of hepatitis D virus RNA positivity was observed in both groups at the end of treatment. Thus, whereas in baseline samples 10 (62%) of the patients in each group were positive for hepatitis D virus RNA in serum on slot-blot hybridization, these numbers decreased to 5 (31%) and 4 (25%) patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, at the end of therapy. However, hepatitis D virus RNA, detected by means of nested polymerase chain reaction, remained in all but two (one in each group) patients who completed the treatment. Finally, during posttreatment follow-up, hepatitis D virus RNA levels returned to baseline values, and only one patient remained negative for this marker. The beneficial effect of interferon-alpha was only transient. Only two patients (one from each treatment group) had persistently normal serum ALT levels after 18 mo of follow-up. Finally, the presence of serum hepatitis D virus RNA at the end of therapy, detected with nested polymerase chain reaction, might be a good marker for the prediction of viral replication relapse.",

The median patient age at recurrence was 57.7 years, and the median diagnosis-to-recurrence interval was 32 months (range, 12-164 months). Complete cytoreduction was achieved in 41 patients (74.5%). On multivariate analysis, the statistically significant and independent predictors of overall survival were a diagnosis-to-recurrence interval >or=18 months (median survival, 49 months vs 3 months; P < .01), the number of radiographic recurrence sites (median survival, 50 months for patients with 1 or 2 sites vs 12 months for patients with 3 to 5 sites; P < .03), and residual disease (median survival, 50 months for patients with no macroscopic residual disease vs 7.2 months for patients with macroscopic residual disease; P < .01).

Compared to three- or four-drug maintenance therapy, maintenance therapies including fewer drugs were associated with a higher risk of virologic failure (loss of HIV suppression to non-detectable levels). Combining the results of all four studies yielded an odds ratio of 5.55 (95% confidence interval, 3.14 - 9.80). Similar results were obtained when the one abstract was excluded (odds ratio, 5.48; 95% confidence interval, 2.82 - 10.65). Performing subgroup analyses of studies using the same induction and maintenance regimens gave similar results.

The total number of newborns enrolled in the study was 84; the SnMP group comprised 40 infants; the control group comprised 44 infants.

Phototherapy was initiated at a PBC of 333.5 micromol/dL (19.5 mg/dL).\n                SnMP entirely eliminated the need for supplemental PT to control hyperbilirubinemia; in contrast, of the 44 control infants, 12 required treatment with PT (27%) when their PBC reached or exceeded the level (333.5 micromol/dL; 19.5 mg/dL) at which time the use of PT was dictated by hospital guidelines. None of the 40 SnMP-treated infants reached a PBC of 19.5 mg/dL. SnMP also markedly diminished the median hours to case closure (SnMP: median, 86.5 hours; minimum/maximum, 24/216 hours; controls: median, 120 hours; minimum/maximum, 72/336 hours); and significantly reduced the number of bilirubin determinations required for clinical monitoring of the infants (SnMP: median, 3; minimum/maximum, 1/9; controls: median, 5; minimum/maximum, 3/11). No adverse effects of SnMP use were observed.\n                A single dose of SnMP proved effective in controlling severe hyperbilirubinemia in full-term breastfed newborns with high bilirubin levels between 48 and 96 hours.

Forty-three patients (30 females and 13 males), mean age 22.9 years (range 18-46 years), with acute dry or slightly productive cough and otherwise healthy were included in the study. Patients were randomized to placebo treatment (n = 22) and dextromethorphan treatment (n=21). The results showed similar trends in both treatment groups with statistically significant reductions (P < 0.05) in cough sound pressure level (CSPL), cough frequency (CF) and subjective scores for cough severity within treatment groups but little difference between the treatment groups during the study period.

Primary outcome was metabolic acidosis, defined as an umbilical cord artery pH below 7.05 combined with a base deficit calculated in the extracellular fluid compartment above 12 mmol/L. Secondary outcomes were metabolic acidosis in blood, operative deliveries, Apgar scores, neonatal admissions, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.\n                We randomly assigned 5,681 women to the two groups (2,832 index, 2,849 control). The fetal blood sampling rate was 10.6% in the index compared with 20.4% in the control group (relative risk 0.52; 95% [CI] 0.46-0.59). The primary outcome occurred 0.7% in the index compared with 1.1% in the control group (relative risk 0.70; 95% CI 0.38-1.28; number needed to treat 252). Using metabolic acidosis calculated in blood, these rates were 1.6% and 2.6%, respectively (relative risk 0.63; 95% CI 0.42-0.94; number needed to treat 100). The number of operative deliveries, low Apgar scores, neonatal admissions, and newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was comparable in both groups.\n                Intrapartum monitoring by cardiotocography combined with ST analysis does not significantly reduce the incidence of metabolic acidosis calculated in the extracellular fluid compartment. It does reduce the incidence of metabolic acidosis calculated in blood and the need for fetal blood sampling without affecting the Apgar score, neonatal admissions, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, or operative deliveries.\n                I.",

        "document": "A growing number of people is subject to age-related cognitive impairment due to the proportional increase of the ageing population. Therefore, there is a growing interest in cognition-enhancing substances. The efficacy of an alcohol/water extract of Ginkgo biloba in elderly individuals with memory- and/or concentration complaints was tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study by using both subjective and objective parameters. After a wash-out period of 4 weeks 241 non-institutionalised patients in the age range 55-86 years were randomly allocated to receive either Ginkgo biloba alcohol/water extract in a high dose (HD), a low dose (LD) or a placebo (PL) for 24 weeks. Patients were assessed using a psychometric testbattery in the following order: Expended Mental Control Test (EMCT) measuring attention and concentration, Benton Test of Visual Retention-Revised (measures short term visual memory), Rey Test part 1 (measures short term memory and learning curve), Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI) measuring the presence and severeness of a depression in order to exclude depressive patients and Rey Test part 2 (measures long term memory: recognition). Furthermore, subjective perception of memory and concentration was measured. 197 patients completed the study (mean MMSE score: 26.29). In the subjective test, the EMCT, the Rey 1 and Rey 2 no significant differences in improvement in time between the groups were observed. In the Benton test increases of 18%, 26% and 11% (expressed as percentage of baseline scores) were observed in the HD, LD and PL respectively (MANOVA; p = 0.0076). No substantial correlation was observed between subjective perception of the severeness of memory complaints and the objective test results. No differences in the number of (gastrointestinal) side effects were observed between placebo and verum groups. These results indicate that the use of Ginkgo extracts in elderly individuals with cognitive impairment might be promising. Further research using both subjective and objective measurements is recommended.\n                Copyright \u00a9 1998 Gustav Fischer Verlag. Published by Elsevier GmbH.. All rights reserved.",

        "document": "Patients suffering from atherosclerosis may have a hypercoagulable state which is further aggravated by surgery. Thrombin, a central enzyme in the coagulation process, cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin. Therefore, inhibition of thrombin is an important anticoagulant mechanism. This is accomplished by heparin in concert with antithrombin III (AT), but vessel wall glycosaminoglycans may act as substitutes for heparin and catalyse thrombin inhibition. The present study examines whether administration of AT or heparin is effective as an anticoagulant during infrainguinal bypass surgery. Preoperatively and during surgery the patients had elevated levels of fibrinogen, fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and thrombin-antithrombin (T-AT) complexes. There were higher levels of FPA in the venous outflow from the ischemic leg than in the arterial inflow. Taken together these measurements indicate ongoing coagulation in the operated leg. Administration of heparin decreased FPA levels and prevented intraoperative graft thrombosis, whereas in patients receiving AT, T-AT levels increased but FPA levels were unchanged. In the latter group, intraoperative graft thrombosis occurred in a high proportion. Based on additional case histories in these patients with hypercoagulability, it is suggested that fibrinogen is a risk factor for thromboembolic complications and that a combination of low dose of heparin and AT might be an effective regimen to prevent intraoperative thrombosis with a low risk of haemorrhage.",

Fifty children were randomized to treatment groups receiving either a PUFA supplement providing a daily dose of 480 mg DHA, 80 mg EPA, 40 mg arachidonic acid (AA), 96 mg GLA, and 24 mg alpha-tocopheryl acetate, or an olive oil placebo for 4 mon of double-blind parallel treatment. Supplementation with the PUFA led to a substantial increase in the proportions of EPA, DHA, and alpha-tocopherol in the plasma phospholipids and red blood cell (RBC) total lipids, but an increase was noted in the plasma phospholipid proportions of 18:3n-3 with olive oil as well. Significant improvements in multiple outcomes (as rated by parents) were noted in both groups, but a clear benefit from PUFA supplementation for all behaviors characteristic of AD/HD was not observed. For most outcomes, improvement of the PUFA group was consistently nominally better than that of the olive oil group; but the treatment difference was significant, by secondary intent-to-treat analysis, on only 2 out of 16 outcome measures: conduct problems rated by parents (-42.7 vs. -9.9%, n = 47, P = 0.05), and attention symptoms rated by teachers (-14.8 vs. +3.4%, n = 47, P = 0.03). PUFA supplementation led to a greater number of participants showing improvement in oppositional defiant behavior from a clinical to a nonclinical range compared with olive oil supplementation (8 out of 12 vs. 3 out of 11, n = 33, P = 0.02). Also, significant correlations were observed when comparing the magnitude of change between increasing proportions of EPA in the RBC and decreasing disruptive behavior as assessed by the Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire (ASQ) for parents (r = -0.38, n = 31, P < 0.05), and for EPA and DHA in the RBC and the teachers' Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) Rating Scale for Attention (r = -0.49, n = 24, P < 0.05). Interestingly, significant correlations were observed between the magnitude of increase in alpha-tocopherol concentrations in the RBC and a decrease in scores for all four subscales of the teachers' DBD (Hyperactivity, r = -0.45; Attention, r= -0.60; Conduct, r = -0.41; Oppositional/Defiant Disorder, r = -0.54; n = 24, P < 0.05) as well as the ASQ for teachers (r = -0.51, n = 24, P < 0.05).

Potential adverse effects of oral erythromycin and complications associated with parenteral nutrition were assessed as secondary outcomes.\n                Twenty seven and 29 infants received oral erythromycin and placebo solution respectively. The times taken to establish half, three quarters, and full enteral feeding after the drug treatment were significantly shorter in the group receiving oral erythromycin than in those receiving the placebo (p < 0.05, p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001 respectively). There was also a trend suggesting that more infants with prolonged feed intolerance developed cholestatic jaundice in the placebo than in the oral erythromycin group (10 v 5 infants). None of the infants receiving oral erythromycin developed cardiac dysrhythmia, pyloric stenosis, or septicaemia caused by multiresistant organisms.\n                Oral erythromycin is effective in facilitating enteral feeding in preterm very low birthweight infants with moderately severe gastrointestinal dysmotility. Treated infants can achieve full enteral feeding 10 days earlier, and this may result in a substantial saving on hyperalimentation. However, until the safety of erythromycin has been confirmed in preterm infants, this treatment modality should remain experimental.
