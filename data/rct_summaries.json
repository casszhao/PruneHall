Inability to intubate the nostril in three neonates, and respiratory or cardiac instability during attempted NT intubation in three neonates, resulted in the assignment of 52 infants to the OT group and 39 infants to the NT group; patients in both groups were of comparable size, sex, and clinical problems. Initial malposition of the endotracheal tube and need to retape, reposition, or replace the tube during the mean duration of intubation of 247 +/- 42 hours for the OT group and 273 +/- 57 hours for the NT group were similar. Daily Gram stains of tracheal aspirates showed that inflammation (greater than or equal to ten polymorphonuclear cells per 400 power fields) was common (51% OT group, 53% NT group). Cultures grew potential pathogens in 37% of the patients from the OT group and 31% of the NT group. There was no difference in the clinical or radiologic incidence of pneumonia. Postextubation problems were comparable: atelectasis, 48% OT and 59% NT; stridor, 15% OT and 26% NT. OT intubation may be preferred for prolonged ventilatory assistance in neonates because of the relative ease of initial intubation.",

In phase I, 4 of 10 babies in the CMT group died and 9 of 9 babies in the ECMO group survived. Randomization was halted after the fourth CMT death, as planned before initiating the study, and the next 20 babies were treated with ECMO (phase II). Of the 20, 19 survived. All three treatment groups (CMT and ECMO in phase I and ECMO, phase II) were comparable in severity of illness and mechanical ventilator support. The overall survival of ECMO-treated infants was 97% (28 of 29) compared with 60% (6 of 10) in the CMT group (P less than .05). A prospective controlled randomized study of the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to treat newborns with respiratory failure was carried out using the \"randomized play-the-winner\" statistical method. In this method the chance of randomly assigning an infant to one treatment or the other is influenced by the outcome of treatment of each patient in the study. If one treatment is more successful, more patients are randomly assigned to that treatment. A group of 12 infants with birth weight greater than 2 kg met objective criteria for high mortality risk. One patient was randomly assigned to conventional treatment (that patient died); 11 patients were randomly chosen for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (all survived).

RESULTS/DATA ANALYSIS: There were no statistically significant differences in the length of the neonatal intensive care unit stay and in the incidence of sepsis between groups. There was a significant higher incidence of phlebitis in the peripheral intravenous catheter group.\n                Although there was not a significant effect of the kind of catheter on length of neonatal intensive care unit stay, the peripherally inserted central catheter is recommended because of the decreased risk of phlebitis and the decreased number of venipuncture attempts and catheters needed to complete intravenous therapy. To determine whether percutaneously inserted central venous catheters (PICC) and peripheral intravenous catheters (PIV) in infants with very low birth weight (VLBW) differ with respect to (1) incidence of sepsis, (2) number of insertion attempts and catheters required for total intravenous therapy, (3) courses of antibiotics, and (4) total duration of intravenous (IV) use.\n                A randomized comparative trial was conducted involving 63 VLBW infants (<1,251 g) who required IV therapy. Infants were assigned randomly at 1 week of age to either a PIV or a PICC catheter and followed up prospectively until an IV was no longer required or the infant was transferred out of the neonatal intensive care unit.\n                Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. There was no difference in the incidence of sepsis (P = .64), number of courses of antibiotics (P = .16), or total duration of IV use (P= .34) between the 2 groups. The number of insertion attempts required for total IV therapy was significantly lower in the PICC group than in the PIV group (P = .008). There also was a significantly lower number of total catheters utilized in the PICC group (P = .002). When data were controlled for birth weight strata the results were similar.\n                PICC lines reduced the number of painful IV procedures in VLBW infants without additional morbidity. To compare the occurrence of systemic infection or death in preterm infants with elective percutaneous central line (PCVL) placement versus peripheral intravenous catheter (PIV) placement.\n                A total of 96 infants < or =1250 g or < or =30 weeks gestation were randomized by 4 days of age to elective placement of a PCVL or continued use of PIV catheters. The primary outcome of systemic infection (defined as a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture treated for at least 5 days) or death was monitored until the infants did not require intravenous (iv) support for 7 consecutive days.\n                Systemic infection or death occurred in 17/46 (39%) infants in the PCVL group and 14/50 (28%) in the PIV group (relative risk (RR)=1.32 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70, 2.53; risk difference (RD)=0.09 with 95% CI -0.10, 0.28). The PCVL group had significantly fewer skin punctures for iv access.\n                There was no significant difference in systemic infection or death (expressed either as a combined outcome or as separate component outcomes) between the groups. The number of skin punctures was significantly reduced in the PCVL group. Percutaneously inserted central venous catheters (CVCs) are frequently used for parenteral nutrition (PN) in neonates. Catheter-related sepsis (CRS) is the most commonly reported complication. The aim of this study was to compare sepsis rates between neonates receiving PN by CVC and by peripheral cannula. Neonates were randomized to receive PN either by CVC or by peripheral cannula. Primary outcomes were sepsis rates and efficacy of PN delivery. Interim analysis (49 neonates) revealed no difference in sepsis rates (CVC group 46%, cannula group 40%, p = 0.57). There was a significant discrepancy in PN delivered (median deficit 3.2% in the CVC group, 10.3% in the cannula group, p=0.0014). After consideration of these findings the study was terminated. Conclusion: Because the trial was stopped early, small but clinically important differences in the rates of sepsis may have been missed. Neonates in the cannula group accrued significant deficits of PN owing to a lack of venous access. This may contribute to undernutrition in neonates. CVC can be advocated for PN administration, in that sepsis appears to be no higher than when using cannulae and delivery of nutrition is significantly better.",

Fifty-five women in the third trimester were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: a period of rest, 'relaxing' reflexology techniques or a specific 'lymphatic' reflexology technique for 15 min with pre- and post-therapy ankle and foot circumference measurements and participant questionnaire. There was no statistically significant difference in the circumference measurements between the three groups; however, the lymphatic technique reflexology group mean circumference measurements were all decreased. A significant reduction in the women's symptom mean measurements in all groups (p<0.0001) was apparent. A 'perceived wellbeing' score revealed the lymphatic technique group (p<0.0001) significantly increased their wellbeing the most, followed closely by relaxing techniques (p<0.001) and then the control rest group (p<0.03). Lymphatic reflexology techniques, relaxing reflexology techniques and a period of rest had a non-significant oedema-relieving effect. From the women's viewpoint, lymphatic reflexology was the preferred therapy with significant increase in symptom relief. In a double-blind trial involving 69 patients, the effect of O-(beta-hydroxyethyl) rutoside (HR)* in the treatment of varicosis of pregnancy has been investigated. The number of patients subjectively improving in the active drug group was significantly greater than in the placebo group; patients receiving HR also showed a small but significant decrease in leg circumference. Throughout the eight-week period of the trial, there were only minimal side-effects and healthy babies were delivered with good Apgar-scores. This study explored the differential effects of external pneumatic intermittent compression (EPIC) and posturing on leg volume changes in healthy pregnant women with dependent leg edema. Thirty-five healthy pregnant women with severe pedal edema were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. The experimental group (n = 17) received EPIC for 30 minutes at 40 torr while in the left lateral recumbent position. Control women (n = 18) were similarly positioned, but received no EPIC. Both groups walked for 10 minutes following left lateral posturing. Circumference measures required for leg volume estimates were made: prior to posturing (Time 1), immediately after posturing (Time 2), and following the ambulation period (Time 3). Volume losses for the experimental group were greater than for the control group at Time 2. Although volume losses for the experimental group had reversed somewhat at Time 3, they remained greater than control group losses, which did not change from Time 2 to Time 3. Analysis of covariance revealed significant mean volume losses for both experimental and control groups, with ponderal index the only significant covariate.",

The study was a multicentre, open, randomised, controlled study lasting for 4 weeks. Ulcer area and healing were assessed weekly. Odour, maceration, absorption capacity and leakage were evaluated at dressing changes. All adverse events were recorded. One hundred and twenty-nine patients were included (Contreet Foam: 65, Allevyn Hydrocellular: 64). The two groups were comparable in all respects. After 4 weeks, there was a significantly greater reduction in ulcer area in the Contreet Foam group (45%) than in the Allevyn Hydrocellular group (25%). After 1 and 4 weeks, odour was present in significantly less of the ulcers in the Contreet Foam group (17% and 19%, respectively) compared with the Allevyn Hydrocellular group (47% and 39%, respectively) and at the final visit there were significantly fewer leakages in the Contreet Foam group (19%) compared with the Allevyn Hydrocellular group (49%). Also, less maceration was observed after 1 and 4 weeks in the Contreet Foam group (34% and 37%, respectively) compared with the Allevyn Hydrocellular group (55% and 48%, respectively). The occurrence and cause of adverse events were equally distributed between the study groups. The present study provides evidence of the superior performance of the silver-releasing dressing, Contreet Foam, compared with a traditional moist foam wound healing dressing in the treatment of critically colonised, chronic venous leg ulcers. The results of this randomised, controlled study suggest an important role of sustained silver-releasing dressings in the treatment of critically colonised chronic wounds. To compare the effect of the sustained silver-releasing foam dressing Contreet Foam (ColoplastA/S) with local best practice (LBP) on delayed healing ulcers using a real-life setting.\n                A total of 619 patients with ulcers of varying aetiologies were treated for four weeks with either the silver foam dressing or LBP.\n                Wound area was reduced by 50% with the silver foam and 34% with LBP Less slough and maceration, a faster reduction in exudate level and more positive wound progress was achieved with the silver foam. In addition, exudate handling, ease of use, odour and pain improved. Less time was spent on dressing changes, and mean wear time was longer for the silver foam (3.1 days) than for LBP (2.1 days). All differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The silver foam dressing outperformed all of the other dressing categories including moist wound healing products and other silver dressings.\n                This large-scale comparative real-life study shows that the silver foam dressing supports faster healing of delayed healing wounds. To evaluate the clinical impact of using a silver-releasing hydroalginate dressing to minimise the risk of local infection in colonised chronic wounds.\n                This was a randomised (stratification according to wound type) open-label multicentre comparative two-arm parallel-group study. Thirteen centres recruited 99 patients with either a venous leg ulcer or a pressure ulcer. None of the wounds required systemic antibiotics or were associated with lymphangitis and/or fever, but at least two of the following criteria had to be present: continuous pain; erythema; oedema; heat; and moderate to high levels of serous exudate. Patients were allocated to receive either a silver-releasing hydroalginate dressing (Silvercel, the test group) or a pure calcium alginate dressing (Algosteril, the control group). Wounds were assessed daily over 14 days to complete a modified ASEPSIS index to evaluate risk of infection, and then weekly for two additional weeks. A global wound severity score and area tracings were recorded weekly.\n                Fifty-one and 48 patients were randomised in the test and control groups respectively: 28 pressure ulcers and 71 venous leg ulcers. The total mASEPSIS score over 14 days did not differ significantly between groups: 95.4 +/- 62.2 and 104.2 +/- 72.8 in control and test groups respectively (p = 0.791). Of the patients who completed the total four-week study duration, four out of 38 (10.5%) in the control group and none of the 40 in the test group were treated with systemic antibiotics at the final visit (p = 0.053). According to the investigators, fewer wounds developed a clinical infection over the four-week follow-up in the test group (33% versus 46%; p = 0.223). Overall, the four-week closure rate was statistically greater in the test group (0.32 +/- 0.57cm2/day versus 0.16 +/- 0.40cm2/day; p = 0.024). Compared with baseline, the absolute decrease in wound severity score at week four was higher in the test group (-5.6 +/- 3.2 versus -4.1 +/- 4.3; p = 0.063); this was also true of the percentage reduction (-32 +/- 17% versus -23 +/- 25%; p = 0.034). Poor dressing acceptability and/or tolerability was noted in five out of 48 patients (10.4%) in the control group and in five out of 51 (9.8%) in the test group.\n                This study suggests that the use of silver-releasing dressings in the management of wounds at high risk of infection may have a clinically favourable influence on wound prognosis; the dressings also appeared to be well tolerated. However, the evaluation of these advantages in controlled clinical trials is complex and requires potent studies and the development of more specific endpoints than those currently used.",

This 40-day randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging multicenter study was designed to assess the effect of sertindole on previously neuroleptic-responsive, hospitalized schizophrenic patients (n = 205). Sertindole doses began at 4 mg/day and were increased to 8, 12, or 20 mg/day, depending on randomization. Efficacy measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed by movement rating scales, EPS-related adverse events, and use of anti-EPS medications. A dose-related improvement was observed for PANSS, BPRS, and CGI, with statistically significant mean differences (P < 0.05) between placebo and 20-mg/day sertindole (decreases from baseline of -5.8 versus -16.9 for PANSS, -4.8 versus -10.4 for BPRS, respectively). The differences in CGI final improvement score between placebo and 20-mg/day sertindole were 3.8 versus 2.9, respectively. EPS-related events were comparable in the placebo and sertindole groups. In conclusion, sertindole 20 mg/day was effective, well tolerated, and not associated with significant motor system abnormalities. Sertindole is an atypical antipsychotic that is efficacious in schizophrenia and is associated infrequently with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). This study assessed time to treatment failure with 24 mg/day sertindole or 10 mg/day haloperidol in 282 clinically stable neuroleptic-responsive outpatients with schizophrenia. During a 5-week transition period, patients were randomized to treatment with sertindole or haloperidol; other treatments were gradually discontinued. Patients then received treatment through Day 365. Time to treatment failure was numerically superior in sertindole-treated patients compared with haloperidol-treated patients, although this difference was not statistically significant. Sertindole-treated patients, however, remained free of hospitalization for exacerbation of schizophrenia and remained medically compliant significantly longer than did haloperidol-treated patients. In addition, there were significantly fewer reports of EPS in sertindole-treated patients and sertindole therapy was generally well tolerated. Patients transitioned well from other antipsychotic agents to sertindole. Sertindole appears to be an effective long-term treatment for schizophrenia.",

        "document": "Postponing Sexual Involvement (PSI) is a widely implemented middle school curriculum designed to delay the onset of sexual intercourse. In an evaluation of its effectiveness among seventh and eighth graders in California, 10,600 youths from schools and community-based organizations statewide were recruited and participated in randomly assigned intervention or control groups; the curriculum was implemented by either adult or youth leaders. Survey data were collected before the program was implemented, and at three months and 17 months afterward. At three months, small but statistically significant changes were found in fewer than half of the measured attitudes, behaviors and intentions related to sexual activity; at 17 months, none of these significant positive effects of the PSI program had been sustained. At neither follow-up were there significant positive changes in sexual behavior; Youths in treatment and control groups were equally likely to have become sexually active, and youths in treatment groups were not less likely than youths in control groups to report a pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection. The evaluation suggests that PSI may be too modest in length and scope to have an impact on youths' sexual behavior. Conducted in diverse sociocultural communities in Los Angeles County, the project implemented and evaluated a family life education program designed to prevent the negative outcomes of risky sexual behavior. A sample of 251 male and female early adolescents 9 through 14 years of age participated with their parents in this abstinence-based adolescent pregnancy prevention program. The project sought to improve parent-child communications and delay the onset of sex-related behaviors through direct involvement of parents in the education process. Naturally occurring community groups were randomly assigned by site to treatment or delayed treatment conditions in a longitudinal quasi-experimental evaluation design. The evaluation demonstrated significant improvements in communication between parents and children immediately following the intervention; however, these improvements were no longer present 12 months postintervention. The process and outcome evaluation methods employed in the study triangulated qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis procedures. This combination provided other sources of data than the traditional outcome measures used in most evaluation studies, thus addressing some of the gaps in present program evaluations. Descriptions of the process evaluation, integrated with the outcome data, are intended to heighten nurses' awareness of the importance of this component of research and the rich qualitative data it may yield. The qualitative process components in the project captured the experience of the investigators when they encountered many of the complex challenges that confront researchers who implement and evaluate family life education programs among early adolescents. This experience provided the basis for suggested strategies that nurse clinicians and researchers can use in their work with early adolescents and their parents in clinical-, school-, and community-based settings. The quality of parent-child communications about sex and sexuality appears to be a strong determinant of adolescents' sexual behavior. Evaluations of interventions aimed at improving such communications can help identify strategies for preventing early onset of sexual behavior.\n                A school-based abstinence-only curriculum was implemented among 351 middle school students, who were randomly assigned to receive either the classroom instruction alone or the classroom instruction enhanced by five homework assignments designed to be completed by the students and their parents. An experimental design involving pretest and posttest surveys was used to assess the relative efficacy of the curriculum delivered with and without the parent-child homework assignments.\n                In analyses of covariance controlling for baseline scores, immediately after the intervention, adolescents who received the enhanced curriculum reported greater self-efficacy for refusing high-risk behaviors than did those who received the classroom instruction only (mean scores, 16.8 vs. 15.8). They also reported less intention to have sex before finishing high school (0.4 vs. 0.5), and more frequent parent-child communications about prevention (1.6 vs. 1.0) and sexual consequences (1.6 vs. 1.1). In all significant comparisons, the direction of the findings favored adolescents who received the enhanced curriculum. Dose-response relationships supported the findings.\n                Parent-child homework assignments designed to reinforce and support school-based prevention curricula can have an immediate impact on several key determinants of sexual behavior among middle school adolescents. This study was undertaken to determine whether the Adult Identity Mentoring (AIM) project successfully promotes abstinence, delays initiation of sex, and decreases intention to engage in sex.\n                Twenty middle school classes of African-American seventh graders were randomly assigned to receive either the AIM intervention or a standard health education control curriculum. The AIM is a 10-session curriculum based on the theory of possible selves. Class exercises encourage students to articulate a possible future self-identity and to develop self-promotion skills. Surveys about sexual activity were conducted before the intervention, 19 weeks after baseline, and again at 1 year after the intervention.\n                Hierarchical logistic regression analyses showed significant effects for the intervention on sexual intentions, abstinence, and a trend toward fewer virgins initiating intercourse for the first time, 19 weeks after baseline. Specifically, students who received the intervention showed decreased intention to engage in sex and increased abstinence compared with students not receiving the intervention. Effects for 1-year follow-up, with smaller sample size, showed only that AIM male participants maintained the significant abstinence effect.\n                A new intervention, AIM was evaluated among African-American seventh graders. This program, by focusing students on positive future selves, effectively modified sexual risk without directly providing instruction on sexually explicit topics.",

In some respects the residents of the hostel ward had fewer psychotic impairments than those remaining on the wards of the district general hospital, mainly because the latter seem to continue to acquire such defects, while the former have remained relatively unchanged. The hostel ward residents also develop superior domestic skills, use more facilities in the community, and are more likely to be engaged in constructive activities than controls. These advantages were not purchased at a price, since the cost of providing this form of care for these patients has cost less than care provided by the district general hospital.",

Currently, the value of this way of supporting people - which could be considerable - is unclear. Trials are needed. Any 24 hour care 'ward-in-a-house' is likely to be oversubscribed. We argue that the only equitable way of providing care in this way is to draw lots as to who is allocated a place from the eligible group of people with serious mental illness. With follow-up of all eligible for the placements - those who were lucky enough to be allocated a place as well as people in more standard type of care - real-world evaluation could take place. In the UK further randomised control trials are probably impossible, as many of these types of facilities have closed. The broader lesson of this review is to ensure early and rigorous evaluation of fashionable innovations before they are superseded by new approaches.",

Following coronary artery bypass graft procedures, 49 male subjects had their chest tubes milked every 2 hours, had them stripped every 2 hours, or served as controls (i.e., their tubes were neither milked nor stripped). An analysis of variance was applied to the results. There was no significant difference in total drainage volume, hourly zero drainage, heart rate, or occurrence of arrhythmias among the three groups of subjects. Four to 16 hours postoperatively, a significantly higher volume of drainage occurred in the subjects whose chest tubes had been stripped. Stripping is particularly discouraged during this interval. The chest tubes remained patent with or without milking or stripping. We conclude that neither milking nor stripping is necessary for the proper care of chest tubes. We recommend that tubes be positioned such that they promote continuous drainage. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of two methods of clot clearance on chest tube drainage in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. Two hundred adult patients immediately after myocardial revascularization were randomly assigned to a specific chest tube manipulation group. The dependent variables were drainage, incidence of cardiac tamponade, incidence of surgical reentry, hemodynamic values, and number of manipulation episodes. Statistical analyses revealed no difference in any of the dependent variables when milking and stripping were used. Of the 200 patients, 78 did not require any manipulation of the chest tubes in the first 8 hours after surgery. One patient had signs of cardiac tamponade and six other patients required surgical reentry. Positioning of the connecting tube in a nondependent position assisted with the removal of drainage from the chest cavity. In conclusion, patients having myocardial revascularization did not need their chest tubes manipulated the first 8 hours after surgery. Visible drainage in the chest tube did not cause a lack of patency.",

Eight patients (7 males, 1 female), aged 22 months +/- 2.83 (mean +/- SD) took oxatomide in an oral suspension at the dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, while the other eight (3 males, 5 females; 22.13 months +/- 3.48) took placebo. Efficacy was assessed by monitoring cough, dyspnea at rest, dyspnea following exercise, wheezing, sleep disorders at baseline and after 15, 30 and 60 days of treatment, on the basis of a semiquantitative scale. All side effects were recorded.\n                Persistent coughing was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) after two weeks' treatment with oxatomide. Sleep disorders and other symptoms remarkably improved. Dyspnea at rest and following exercise disappeared after 15 days' therapy, while the intensity of wheezing decreased after 30 days' active treatment. In all parameters examined, oxatomide was significantly more active than placebo at the first examination (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). Oxatomide was well tolerated and only 2 patients complained of drowsiness which required a reduction in dosage.\n                Oxatomide, at the dose of 1 mg/kg/day, obtained a good control of respiratory symptoms. Oxatomide is an orally active H1-histamine receptor antagonist. It has been demonstrated to have therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of allergic diseases in adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oxatomide in the treatment of asthma in children. Sixty-four asthmatic children of both sexes, aged between 5 and 16 years, were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a duration of 4 months. Patients were randomized chosen to receive either oxatomide with a daily dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg body weight or a placebo twice daily. Clinical evaluations including pulmonary function tests and immunological studies. The patients' impression on the effect of treatment also were recorded during the study. The effects of bronchodilatation and normalizing pulmonary function were observed 2 months after oxatomide treatment. The levels of eosinophil cationic protein and total asthma symptom scores were significantly reduced during treatment with oxatomide. There was no significant change in total IgE or IgG4 before or after treatment in either the treatment or control groups. During the study, two (5.8%) oxatomide treated patients reported slight drowsiness and one (2.9%) reported body weight gain. Routine laboratory tests showed no significant alterations.

Moreover, the consequences of respiratory physiotherapy techniques on respiratory mechanics have not been fully studied. Therefore, we investigated the acute, short-term effects of Flutter Valve\u2122 on respiratory mechanics and sputum production in bronchiectatic patients.\u2002\n                EIGHT patients were evaluated in a randomized, blinded, cross-over trial. Impedance at 5\u2009Hz (R5), resistance as a function of oscillation frequency (dR/dF), reactance at 5\u2009Hz (X5), resonant frequency (f(0) ) and integral of reactance between 5\u2009Hz and resonant frequency (AX) were recorded.\u2002\n                Flutter Valve\u2122 cleared 8.4\u2009mL more secretions than the Sham Flutter intervention (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.4-13.4). There was a higher percentage decrease in R5 (-11.2%; 95% CI, -4.4 to -18.2), dR/dF (-20.8%; 95% CI, -32.4 to -9) and AX (-7.8%; 95% CI, -11.9 to -3.7) under Flutter Valve\u2122.

Impulse oscillometry is a user-friendly tool to evaluate the effects of airway clearance techniques on respiratory mechanics.\n                Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. To determine whether sputum clearance is increased by using nebulised saline or terbutaline as an adjunct to chest physiotherapy, a radioaerosol method (using technetium-99m labelled human albumin millimicrospheres) was employed in eight patients with stable bronchiectasis on four occasions, for comparison of sputum clearance with four different regimens. These were: control, with the patient resting in an upright position; chest physiotherapy, by the forced expiration technique with postural drainage; and chest physiotherapy following five minutes' inhalation of either nebulised normal saline or nebulised terbutaline 5 mg. Use of both nebulised saline and nebulised terbutaline immediately before chest physiotherapy gave a significantly greater yield of sputum than did physiotherapy alone, and terbutaline also significantly increased radioaerosol clearance from the whole lung and from regions of interest. The mechanism is unclear, but this method may provide a simple way of increasing the efficacy of conventional chest physiotherapy. Although respiratory physical therapy is considered fundamental in the treatment of hypersecretive patients, there is little evidence of its physiological and therapeutic effects in bronchiectasis patients.\n                To evaluate the acute physiological effects of ELTGOL and Flutter VRP1\u00ae in dynamic and static lung volumes in patients with bronchiectasis and, secondarily, to study the effect of these techniques in sputum elimination. Methods: Patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of bronchiectasis were included. Patients underwent three interventions in a randomized order and with a one-week washout interval between them. Before all interventions patients inhaled two puffs of 100 mcg of salbutamol. There was a cough period of five minutes before and after the control protocol and the interventions (ELTGOL and Flutter VRP1\u00ae). After each cough series patients underwent assessments of dynamic and static lung volumes by spirometry and plethysmography. The expectorated secretions were collected during the interventions and during the second cough series, and quantified by its dry weight.\n                We studied 10 patients, two males and eight females (mean age: 55.9\u00b118.1 years). After using Flutter VRP1\u00aeand ELTGOL there was a significant decrease in residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC) (p<0.05). There was a higher sputum production during ELTGOL compared with Control and Flutter VRP1\u00ae (p<0.05).\n                The ELTGOL and Flutter VRP1\u00ae techniques acutely reduced lung hyperinflation, but only the ELTGOL increased the removal of pulmonary secretions from patients with bronchiectasis. Regular chest physiotherapy is advocated in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis despite little evidence supporting its routine use. This study aimed to establish the efficacy of regular chest physiotherapy in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis compared with no regular chest physiotherapy. 20 patients not practising regular chest physiotherapy were enrolled in a randomised crossover trial of 3 months of twice daily chest physiotherapy using an oscillatory positive expiratory pressure device compared with 3 months of no chest physiotherapy. The primary end-point was the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). Additional outcomes included 24-h sputum volume, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC (FEF(25-75%)), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), exercise capacity, sputum microbiology and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The treatment effect was estimated using the differences of the pairs of observations from each patient. There was a significant improvement in all domains and total LCQ score with regular chest physiotherapy (median (interquartile range) total score improvement 1.3 (-0.17-3.25) units; p = 0.002). 24-h sputum volume increased significantly with regular chest physiotherapy (2 (0-6) mL; p = 0.02), as did exercise capacity (40 (15-80) m; p = 0.001) and SGRQ total score (7.77 (-0.99-14.5) unit improvement; p = 0.004). No significant differences were seen in sputum bacteriology, FEV(1), FVC, FEF(25-75%), MIP or MEP.

New cases entering Medicaid in selected counties during February through May 2000 were assigned randomly to experimental or control groups. The control group received standard Medicaid enrollment materials, and the experimental group received these materials plus a CAHPS report. We found that CAHPS information did not affect health plan choices by Iowa Medicaid beneficiaries, similar to previously reported findings for New Jersey Medicaid. However, it did affect plan choice in an earlier laboratory experiment. The value of this information may be limited to a subset of receptive consumers who actively study information received, even then only when (1) ratings of available plans differ greatly, (2) ratings differ from prior beliefs about plan quality, and (3) reports are easy to understand. To assess the effects of CAHPS health plan performance information on plan choices and decision processes by New Jersey Medicaid beneficiaries.\n                The study sample was a statewide sample of all new Medicaid cases that chose Medicaid health plans during April 1998. The study used state data on health maintenance organization (HMO) enrollments and survey data for a subset of these cases.\n                An experimental design was used, with new Medicaid cases randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. The experimental group received a CAHPS report along with the standard enrollment materials, and the control group did not.\n                The HMO enrollment data were obtained from the state in June 1998, and evaluation survey data were collected from July to October 1998.\n                No effects of CAHPS information on HMO choices were found for the total sample. Further examination revealed that only about half the Medicaid cases said they received and read the plan report and there was an HMO with dominant Medicaid market share but low CAHPS performance scores. The subset of cases who read the report and did not choose this dominant HMO chose HMOs with higher CAHPS scores, on average, than did those in an equivalent control group.\n                Health plan performance information can influence plan choices by Medicaid beneficiaries, but will do so only if they actually read it. These findings suggest a need for enhancing dissemination of the information as well as further education to encourage informed choices.

During the follow-up period, the mean 30-day AMI mortality rates were 2.5% lower (95% CI, 0.1% to 4.9%; P = .045) in the early feedback group compared with the delayed feedback group. The hospital mortality rates for CHF were not significantly different.\n                Public release of hospital-specific quality indicators did not significantly improve composite process-of-care indicators for AMI or CHF.\n                http://clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00187460.

Secondary objectives were to test whether favorable outliers attract more patients with related conditions, or from outside their catchment areas; and whether disadvantaged groups are less responsive to report cards.\n                We used a time-series analysis using linear and autoregressive models.\n                We studied patients admitted to nonfederal hospitals designated as outliers in reports on coronary bypass surgery (CABG) mortality in New York, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality in California, and postdiskectomy complications in California.\n                We studied observed versus expected hospital volume for topic and related conditions and procedures, by month/quarter after a report card, with and without stratification by age, race/ethnicity, insurance, and catchment area. Potential confounders included statewide prevalence, prereport hospital volume and market share, and unrelated volume.\n                In California, low-mortality and high-mortality outliers did not experience changes in AMI volume after adjusting for autocorrelation. Low-complication outliers for lumbar diskectomy experienced slightly increased volume in autoregressive models. No other cohorts demonstrated consistent trends. In New York, low-mortality outliers experienced significantly increased CABG volume in the first month after publication, whereas high-mortality outliers experienced decreased volume in the second month. The strongest effects were among white patients and those with HMO coverage in California, and among white or other patients and those with Medicare in New York.\n                Volume effects were modest, transient, and largely limited to white Medicare patients in New York.",

        "document": "A modular tube feeding recipe (MTF) was designed to meet the unique nutritional needs of burn patients, applying principles previously documented in our burned guinea pig model. MTF, a high-protein, low-fat, linoleic acid-restricted formulation is enriched with omega-3 fatty acids, arginine, cysteine, histidine, vitamin A, zinc, and ascorbic acid. Fifty patients, 3 to 76 years of age with burns ranging from 10 to 89% total body surface area were prospectively randomized into three groups which blindly compared MTF to two enteral regimens widely utilized in the nutritional support of burns. Age, percent total and third-degree burn, resting energy expenditure, and calorie and protein intake were similar in all groups. Data analysis demonstrated significant superiority of MTF in the reduction of wound infection (p less than 0.03) and length of stay/percent burn (p less than 0.02). MTF was also associated with a decreased incidence of diarrhea, improved glucose tolerance, lower serum triglycerides, reduced total number of infectious episodes and trends toward improved preservation of muscle mass, although statistical significance was not achieved. Seventy percent of deaths occurred in the group supported with an inherently large dose of fat and linoleic acid. Combining these observations, it is believed that MTF is effective in modulating an improved response to burn injury. The optimal amount and type of fat in the nutrition support of burned patients have not been determined. The aim of this study was to test low-fat nutritional solutions, with or without fish oil, on protein metabolism, morbidity, and length of care in severely burned adults.\n                In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 43 patients were assigned to one of the following groups: control (35% fat), low-fat solution (ie, 15% of total calories as fat), low-fat with fish oil, given for 30 days. Nitrogen balance, urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion, urinary cortisol, and clinical status were measured daily. Corticosteroid-binding globulin and total and free serum cortisol were measured every 3 days.\n                Compared with controls, patients on low-fat support had fewer cases of pneumonia: 3/24 vs 7/13 (p = .02), better respiratory and nutrition status, and shorter time to healing: 1.2 vs 1.8 days/% burned area (p = 0.01). There was no difference in nitrogen balance between groups, and 3-methylhistidine excretion was higher and serum free cortisol was lower in log-fat--fed patients than in controls. There was no difference between the two low-fat groups in any of the parameters measured.\n                This study showed that low-fat nutrition support decreases infectious morbidity and shortens length of stay in burn patients. Fish oil does not seem to add clinical benefit to low-fat solutions. In addition, this study provides the first evidence that nutrition intervention modulates cortisol-binding globulin and the concentration of free circulating cortisol after a severe stress.",

The treatment period was 16 weeks. The doses of 1 alpha-OH-D3 were 1.0 microgram/day and 2.0 micrograms/day. It was permissible to use non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs for basic treatment and oral steroidal preparations for maintenance treatment without changing the doses of these drugs during the study period in patients who had been treated with them before participating in the study (for oral steroidal preparations, the dose was limited to 5 mg/day or less as prednisolone). The percentage of patients with slight improvement was about 10% higher in 1 alpha-OH-D3 groups than in placebo group, but the difference between them was not significant. The results tended to be better in the treated groups than in the placebo group, but there was no significant difference between them with regard to duration of morning stiffness, number of joints with pain, number of joints with swelling and Lansbury's index. The effects of 1 alpha-OH-D3 on various immunological parameters including lymphocyte subsets were not clearly demonstrated. However, interestingly, the ratio of OKT-4/OKT-8 was found not to change in patients whose initial value was normal, while it tended to decrease after 1 alpha-OH-D3 treatment in patients whose initial value was abnormally high. The improvement of bone atrophy was judged by microdensitometry (MD) method using X-ray picture of hands. The indexes of bone density (GS max, GS min and sigma GS/D) demonstrated that 1 alpha-OH-D3 prevents reduction in bone density. 1 alpha-OH-D3 did not trigger hypercalcemia in any case. However there was a slight but significant increase of serum Ca value in the group with higher dose (2.0 micrograms/day). Taking the efficacy into consideration, the dose of 1.0 microgram/day was judged to be suitable for long-term treatment. Twenty-four patients (9 M and 15 F, age range 51-82) with polymyalgia rheumatica receiving 6-methylprednisolone for a period of 9 months (16 mg/daily/two weeks, 14 mg/daily/two weeks, 12 mg/daily/1 month, 10 mg/daily/1 month, 8 mg/daily/1 month, 6 mg/daily/1 month and 4 mg/daily for the last four months) were randomly assigned to receive either 250HD3 (35 mcg/day for 25 days/month) (Group A) or placebo (Group B) in a double-blind study. All patients also received 500 mg elemental calcium daily. Before and at 3, 6 and 9 months ESR, tenderness on palpation and subjective pain were evaluated. At the same times, mineral metabolism parameters (serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, 24-h urinary calcium, phosphate and 24-h hydroxyproline excretion) and radial bone mineral content (BMC) were evaluated. Activity indexes (ESR and clinical parameters) improved in both groups. Furthermore, serum alkaline phosphatase and 24-h hydroxyproline excretion decreased significantly only in Group A, and BMC decreased significantly in Group B but rose slightly in Group A.

        "document": "A randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of high-dose, pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone was carried out in 50 individuals with multiple sclerosis; 22 patients were in acute relapse and 28 had chronic progressive disease. After a baseline assessment using the Kurtzke functional and expanded disability status scales each patient was randomly allocated to intravenous treatment with methylprednisolone (500 mg) or a saline placebo administered as a single daily dose for 5 days. Clinical assessments were repeated at 1 and 4 weeks after starting treatment. The results from all 50 patients showed a highly significant effect in favour of methylprednisolone treatment (p less than 0.001). In patients with relapse, there was a significant decrease in clinical disability scores at 1 and 4 weeks in the methylprednisolone treated group compared with controls (p less than 0.05 for each comparison). In the chronic progressive group, disability scores at 4 weeks only were significantly lower after treatment with methylprednisolone (p less than 0.01), mainly attributable to improvement in pyramidal function. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of high-dose (i.e. 1000 mg per day) intravenous methylprednisolone (HDMP) on event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited by a standard auditory 'oddball' paradigm, in patients with clinically active multiple sclerosis. In a double-blind study design, forty-four consecutive inpatients were randomly assigned in two clinically similar groups of 22 subjects each; one treated with HDMP for five days, and other with placebo. ERPs were recorded before and after the treatment. After HDMP therapy the P3 peak latency was significantly shortened (P=0.006), while peak latencies of other waves (i.e. N1, P2, and N2) remained unchanged. On the other hand, ERPs were uninfluenced by placebo treatment. Our results suggest the beneficial effect of intravenous HDMP therapy on, at least some aspects of, cognitive processing capabilities (as assessed by the auditory ERPs) in patients with multiple sclerosis. We conducted a double-blind trial of high-dose parenteral 6-methylprednisolone (MP) and placebo on 23 patients with acute MS. After the double-blind trial, the patients were given corticosteroids in gradually decreasing doses. The frequency of improvement was significantly higher and the bout duration significantly lower in the MP group than in the placebo group. The first signs of improvement (3 to 6 days after starting MP) were associated with a marked decrease in the rate of CNS IgG synthesis, but IgG CSF oligoclonal bands did not change. CNS IgG production slowly returned toward baseline despite progressive clinical improvement. There is only limited evidence from adequately controlled clinical trials to support high-dose methylprednisolone therapy for attacks of multiple sclerosis (MS) and none supporting oral administration. We assessed the effect of oral high-dose methylprednisolone therapy in attacks of MS.\n                Twenty-five patients with an attack of MS lasting less than 4 weeks were randomized to placebo treatment. Twenty-six patients received oral methylprednisolone (500 mg once a day for 5 days with a 10-day tapering period). The patients received scores on the Scripps Neurological Rating Scale (NRS) and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale. The symptoms were scored on a visual analog scale (VAS) before treatment and after 1, 3, and 8 weeks of treatment. Primary efficacy measures were NRS and VAS scores in the first 3 weeks and changes in NRS score and answers to an efficacy questionnaire administered after 8 weeks of treatment.\n                Changes in NRS scores among methylprednisolone- and placebo-treated patients differed significantly in the first 3 weeks and after 8 weeks (p = 0.005 and p = 0.0007). VAS scores the first 3 weeks and treatment efficacy after 8 weeks also favored a beneficial effect of methylprednisolone treatment (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05). After 1, 3, and 8 weeks, 4%, 24%, and 32% in the placebo group and 31%, 54%, and 65% in the methylprednisolone group had improved one point on the Expanded Disability Status Scale score (all p < 0.05).

Patients were randomly allocated to two parallel groups. Sixty-four patients were chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa; they received either amiloride or placebo as a nebulized solution three times daily for 6 months. Routine treatments were continued. Patients chronically colonized with Pseudomonas received nebulized colimycine twice a day for a month during the third and sixth months of treatment. Bronchopulmonary exacerbations were treated in the usual way. The effects of the amiloride treatment were assessed at the end of the 6-month treatment period. The effects on FVC and secondarily on FEV(1), FEF(25-75), the number of days on antibiotic therapy, the Shwachman score, a nutritional index (weight/height(2)), the change in sputum bacterial flora, and nocturnal cough were assessed. For the patients not chronically colonized with Pseudomonas, the effect of the treatment was also evaluated by counting chronic colonizations with pathogens appearing during the trial period. The present study failed to demonstrate any significant benefit of amiloride over placebo on FVC, FEV(1), and the other secondary endpoints in the studied population. Neither the chronically colonized, nor the noncolonized patients benefited. The confidence intervals of the differences between treatment groups indicated small differences that were most likely of no clinical significance. Complementary analyses taking into account the gender, the type of mutation, the subpopulations whose FVC and FEV(1) were below 80% of normal values at the beginning of the study, and also patients less than 10 years old, did not show any statistically or clinically significant improvements following amiloride therapy.\n                Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. To assess the benefit of nebulised amiloride added to the standard inpatient treatment of a respiratory exacerbation in cystic fibrosis.\n                Prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial.\n                27 cystic fibrosis patients (mean age 12.8 years).\n                Two hospitals in Leeds, UK.\n                Both forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) showed improvements over the course of treatment, although there was no difference in respiratory function between the two groups at any of three time periods during the study. The time to reach peak FVC was significantly reduced in the amiloride group (4.2 v 7.6 days; 95% CI 0.4 to 6.4 days), but not in the time to reach peak FEV1 (5.7 v 7.9 days; 95% CI -1.2 to 5.6 days).\n                Amiloride did not result in a greater overall improvement in respiratory function. There was a suggestion that it may have an effect on the rate of improvement, and thus may possibly influence the duration of treatment. This hypothesis deserves further evaluation. In cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelial sodium absorption is increased 2-3 fold. Since sodium absorption is inhibited by the sodium channel blocker amiloride, our aim was to assess its therapeutic benefit in cystic fibrosis. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of nebulized amiloride was performed in 23 patients with cystic fibrosis. Amiloride or placebo was administered four times daily for two six month periods. Existing treatment was continued, and any infective exacerbations treated in the usual way. Fourteen patients completed the study. No significant changes occurred in forced expiratory volume in one second, forced vital capacity, oxygen saturation, body weight, sputum volume, culture and rheology, serum urea, and electrolytes, white cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate during either treatment period. The frequency of infective exacerbations was also not different in either treatment period. We were thus unable to confirm the benefit shown in the only other clinical trial of nebulized amiloride in cystic fibrosis and conclude that, in the presence of established treatment for cystic fibrosis lung disease, nebulized amiloride offers no additional clinical benefit. Abnormal homeostasis of the volume of airway surface liquid in patients with cystic fibrosis is thought to produce defects in mucus clearance and airway defense. Through osmotic forces, hypertonic saline may increase the volume of airway surface liquid, restore mucus clearance, and improve lung function.\n                A total of 24 patients with cystic fibrosis were randomly assigned to receive treatment with inhaled hypertonic saline (5 ml of 7 percent sodium chloride) four times daily with or without pretreatment with amiloride. Mucus clearance and lung function were measured during 14-day baseline and treatment periods.\n                Long-term inhalation of hypertonic saline without pretreatment with amiloride (i.e., with placebo pretreatment) resulted in a sustained (> or =8 hours) increase in 1-hour rates of mucus clearance, as compared with those with amiloride pretreatment (14.0+/-2.0 vs. 7.0+/-1.5 percent, respectively; P=0.02) and increased 24-hour rates of mucus clearance over baseline. Furthermore, inhalation of hypertonic saline with placebo improved the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) between the baseline period and the treatment period (mean difference, 6.62 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 11.7; P=0.02), whereas hypertonic saline with amiloride did not improve FEV1 (mean difference, 2.9 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -2.2 to 8.0; P=0.23). Forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 percent of FVC (FEF25-75), and respiratory symptoms also significantly improved in patients treated with hypertonic saline and placebo, whereas the residual volume as a proportion of total lung capacity (RV:TLC) did not change in either group. A comparison of the changes in lung function in the two groups showed no significant difference. In vitro data suggested that sustained hydration of airway surfaces was responsible for the sustained improvement in mucus clearance, whereas inhibition of osmotically driven water transport by amiloride accounted for the observed loss of clinical benefit.\n                In patients with cystic fibrosis, inhalation of hypertonic saline produced a sustained acceleration of mucus clearance and improved lung function. This treatment may protect the lung from insults that reduce mucus clearance and produce lung disease.\n                Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society.",

These reductions are all statistically significant (p < 0.05) within groups, and the differences between groups were statistically significant between the TAO-MPn and MPn alone groups. The concentration of methacholine required to induce a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and pulmonary function were not significantly improved in any treatment group. Safety parameters including blood chemistry and hematology, adrenal function assessment; bone densitometry, and muscle strength testing, were not altered significantly. Two patients who received TAO had elevated liver enzyme levels; one required discontinuation of TAO and one experienced spontaneous resolution without intervention. Lack of statistically significant changes in the efficacy parameters were likely a result of small sample size and effects of the glucocorticoid dose taper.\n                TAO is safe and may be a reasonable treatment alternative in a limited trial for patients who are unable to tolerate tapering of their glucocorticoid dosage. Therapy should be guided by the goal of treatment, that is, glucocorticoid dose reduction or improvement of pulmonary function with appropriate monitoring of pulmonary function and adverse effects. Fifteen hospitalized asthmatic children (8 to 18 years old) completed a 2-week randomized, parallel, double-blind placebo-controlled comparison of combination methylprednisolone and placebo troleandomycin, prednisone and troleandomycin (P-TAO) or methylprednisolone-TAO (MPn-TAO). Troleandomycin (250 mg once daily or every other day) and glucocorticoid doses were reduced by a standard protocol. Symptom scores, blood chemistries, pulmonary function tests, airway response to methacholine, and glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics were compared. In each group, a steroid dose reduction of 50% was achieved without a deterioration in symptom scores. Methacholine response was unchanged in all five on methylprednisolone alone, but decreased 3-fold to 30-fold in two of five on combination P-TAO, and four of five on combination MPn-TAO. Troleandomycin decreased MPn clearance by an average of 62% but did not alter prednisolone clearance. Low-dose TAO combined with MPn has a significant effect on methylprednisolone clearance in children, an effect equivalent to that reported with higher dose TAO (1000 mg/d) therapy. In addition, this preliminary study suggests that TAO may decrease bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in severely asthmatic children. A group of 75 subjects with asthma requiring daily corticosteroids for control were enrolled in a 2-yr, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the use of troleandomycin combined with methylprednisolone, compared with methylprednisolone alone, for the management of their asthma. The primary outcome variables were determination of the lowest stable methylprednisolone dose and assessment of corticosteroid side effects. Methylprednisolone dose was adjusted to maintain optimal control of asthma symptoms. A total of 30 patients receiving TAO and 27 patients receiving placebo completed 1 yr; 17 on TAO and 8 on placebo completed 2 yr of double-blind participation. Control of asthma was equivalent in both groups. The vast majority of patients in both groups achieved alternate-day dosing (29 of 30 on TAO and 23 of 27 on placebo in the first year). The lowest stable doses of methylprednisolone achieved were 10.4 mg/day (placebo) versus 6.3 mg/day (TAO) in the 1-yr group (p = 0.03). However, the baseline dose was also significantly higher in the placebo group (22.8 versus 17.6 mg/day in the TAO group). Therefore, the reductions in methylprednisolone dose were not significantly different between treatment groups. Differences were observed between the two treatment groups in serum IgG, fasting blood sugar, serum cholesterol, and progression of osteoporosis. In each instance the more unfavorable response occurred in those subjects receiving TAO. We conclude that the addition of TAO to methylprednisolone was not accompanied by a reduction in corticosteroid side effects compared with treatment with methylprednisolone alone. Furthermore, no evidence was found for a subset of \"TAO responders.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "document": "To compare the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapines and haloperidol in treating patients with amphetamine psychosis.\n                Fifty-eight patients experiencing episode of amphetamine psychosis were randomly assigned to olanzapine (N=29) or haloperidol (N=29) in 1:1 (olanzapine: haloperidol) ratio. All patients started with 5-10 mg/day of the study drug; after each 7-day period, the study drug could be adjusted in 5-mg increments or decrements within the allowed dose range of 5-20 mg/day during the 4-week double-blind period.\n                Clinical response was seen in both treatment groups since the first week. Ninety three percent of the olanzapine patients (N=27 of 29) and 79.3% of the haloperidol patients (N=23 of 27) were clinically improved at endpoint. These differences were not statistically significant (p=0.25). The Simpson-Angus total score change from baseline to endpoint reflected no extrapyramidal symptoms among the olanzapine-treated patients (median=0.0, range=0.0). In contrast, worsening occurred among the haloperidol-treated patients (median=0.2, range=0.0-3.1). The differences of mean change in Simpson Angus Scale significantly favored olanzapine (p<0.01). Change to endpoint on the Barnes Akathisia Scale showed that olanzapine-treated patients' scores were close to the baseline (median=0.0, range=-1.0-0.0), whereas haloperidol-treated patients' scores worsened from the baseline (median=0.0, range=-1.0-3.0). This difference was statistically significant (p=0.02).\n                Both olanzapine and haloperidol were efficacious in the treatment of patients with amphetamine psychosis. Olanzapine was superior to conventional neuroleptic haloperidol in treatment safety with lower frequency and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms.",
        "target_summary": "Only one RCT of treatment for amphetamine psychosis has been published. Outcomes from this trial indicate that antipsychotic medications effectively reduce symptoms of amphetamine psychosis, the newer generation and more expensive antipsychotic medication, olanzapine, demonstrates significantly better tolerability than the more affordable and commonly used medication, haloperidol.\nThere are other two studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. The results of these two studies show that agitation and some psychotic symptoms may be abated within an hour after antipsychotic injection. \nWhether this limited evidence can be applied for amphetamine psychotic patients is not yet known. \nThe medications that should be further investigate are conventional antipsychotics, newer antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. However, naturalistic studies of amphetamine psychotic symptoms and the prevalence of relapse to psychosis in the presence of amphetamine, are also crucial for advising the development of study designs appropriate for further treatment studies of amphetamine psychosis.",

        "document": "This prospective, randomized trial compared treatment with Knowles pins and plates in 62 elderly patients (>50 years) with midclavicular fractures. The clinical outcomes were evaluated at 30 months postoperatively. The mean shoulder score of the Knowles pinning was 85 points and the plating was 84 points (P=.7). Knowles pinning requires significantly shorter operative time (P<.001), smaller wound size (P<.001), shorter hospital stay P=.03), less meperidine use (P=.02), lower complication rate (P=0.04), and less symptomatic hardware (P=.015). If surgery of mid-third clavicular fractures is indicated, fixation with a Knowles pin has more advantages than plate fixation in elderly patients. In this study a comparison of patients with midclavicular nonunion, treated by a combination of internal fixation with dynamic compression plate (DCP) or low-contact DCP (LC-DCP) and application of autogenous corticocancellous chips or sculptured graft on nonunion areas, was performed. Time to union in the patients treated with LC-DCP fixation was shorter than in those treated with DCP fixation (P <.001). Union was obtained in all patients treated with LC-DCP fixation and in 87.5% of those treated with DCP fixation. All of those treated with LC-DCP fixation returned to their original jobs, whereas two patients treated with DCP fixation had to change jobs. According to the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand functional score, at the last follow-up visit, functional outcomes of the patients treated with LC-DCP fixation were more satisfactory (P <.001). The addition of internal fixation of the clavicle with DCP or LC-DCP to application of autogenous corticocancellous chips, or sculptured graft on nonunion areas in patients with midclavicular nonunion, shortens the time to union, increases union rates, and provides satisfactory functional outcomes. This randomised study compared outcomes in patients with displaced fractures of the clavicle treated by open reduction and fixation by a reconstruction plate which was placed either superiorly or three-dimensionally. Between 2003 and 2006, 133 consecutive patients with a mean age of 44.2 years (18 to 60) with displaced midshaft fractures of the clavicle were allocated randomly to a three-dimensional (3D) (67 patients) or superior group (66). Outcome measures included the peri-operative outcome index, delayed union, revision surgery and symptoms beyond 16 weeks. CT was used to reconstruct an image of each affected clavicle and Photoshop 7.0 software employed to calculate the percentage of the clavicular cortical area in the sagittal plane. The patients were reviewed clinically and radiographically at four and 12 months after the operation. The superior plate group had a higher rate of delayed union and had more symptomatic patients than the 3D group (p < 0.05). The percentage comparisons of cortical bone area showed that cortical bone in the superior distal segment is thicker than in the inferior segment, it is also thicker in the anterior mid-section than in the posterior (p < 0.05). If fixation of midshaft fractures of the clavicle with a plate is indicated, a 3D reconstruction plate is better than one placed superiorly, because it is consistent with the stress distribution and shape of the clavicle.",

        "document": "Efficacy and safety of a collagen-alginate topical wound dressing (FIBRACOL Collagen-Alginate Wound Dressing) in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers was compared with that of regular gauze moistened with normal saline. Seventy-five patients with foot ulcers were assigned randomly in a 2:1 ratio to the collagen-alginate test dressing or the gauze dressing. At the end of the study, the mean percent reduction of the wound area was 80.6% +/- 6% in the collagen-alginate dressing group and 61.1% +/- 26% in the gauze dressing group (p = .4692). Thirty-nine (78%) patients treated with the collagen-alginate dressing achieved > or = 75% wound area reduction, compared with 15 (60%) of gauze-treated patients. Complete healing was achieved in 24 (48%) of the collagen-alginate dressing group and 9 (36%) of the gauze dressing group. Wound size, when averaged over the 8-week period and with the duration of the ulcer taken into account, was reduced significantly in the collagen-alginate dressing group, as compared with the gauze dressing group (df = 1, p = .0049). It is concluded that the collagen-alginate test dressing is as or more effective and safe as the currently used treatment. The study aimed at comparing the efficacy and tolerance of an alginate wound dressing with a vaseline gauze dressing in the treatment of diabetic foot lesions.\n                This open-label randomized multicenter controlled study was designed to assess the effect of an up to 6-week treatment with either calcium alginate or vaseline gauze dressings. Lesions were either acute or chronic, under cleansing, and with a surface area of 1-50 cm(2); osteomyelitis and severe hypovascularization were non-inclusion criteria. Dressings were changed every day then, once granulation had occurred, every 2 to 3 days. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients with granulation tissue over 75% of the wound area and having a 40% decrease in wound surface area; secondary outcomes were pain on dressing changes, the number of dressing changes, and adverse events.\n                Seventy-seven patients were enrolled. Due to the premature cessation of treatment in 13 patients, it was decided to reduce the period of the efficacy analysis to 4 weeks (without revising the criteria of efficacy). The success rate was of 42.8% in the calcium alginate group and of 28.5% in the vaseline gauze group (not significant difference). A subsequent analysis of granulation tissue surfaces covering the wounds at week 4 (all surfaces taken together) showed a superiority of calcium alginate (p=0.04). Pain on dressing change was lower in the calcium alginate group (p=0.047) and the total number of dressing changes tended also to be lower (p=0.07). Adverse events, which occurred 4 times in the calcium alginate group and 6 times in the other, were judged independent of the treatments.\n                As compared with vaseline gauze, calcium alginate appears to be more appropriate for topical treatment of diabetic foot lesions in terms of both healing and tolerance. Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are at risk of infection and impaired healing, placing patients at risk of lower extremity amputation. DFU care requires debridement and dressings. A prospective, multicentre study compared clinical efficacy and safety of AQUACEL Hydrofiber dressings containing ionic silver (AQAg) with those of Algosteril calcium alginate (CA) dressings in managing out-patients with Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus and non-ischaemic Wagner Grade 1 or 2 DFUs.\n                Patients stratified by antibiotic use on enrolment were randomly assigned to similar protocols including off-loading, AQAg (n = 67) or CA (n = 67) primary dressings and secondary foam dressings for 8 weeks or until healing. Clinical efficacy measures were healing outcomes and primarily healing speed. Adverse events were recorded.\n                AQAg and CA groups were comparable at baseline. All ulcer healing outcomes improved in both groups. The mean time to healing was 53 days for AQAg ulcers and 58 days for CA ulcers (P = 0.34). AQAg-treated ulcers reduced in depth nearly twice as much as CA-treated ulcers (0.25 cm vs. 0.13 cm; P = 0.04). There was more overall ulcer improvement and less deterioration in AQAg subjects (P = 0.058), particularly in the subset initially using antibiotics (P = 0.02). Safety profiles of both groups were similar.\n                When added to standard care with appropriate off-loading, AQAg silver dressings were associated with favourable clinical outcomes compared with CA dressings, specifically in ulcer depth reduction and in infected ulcers requiring antibiotic treatment. This study reports the first significant clinical effects of a primary wound dressing containing silver on DFU healing.",
        "target_summary": "Currently there is no research evidence to suggest that alginate wound dressings are more effective in healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes than other types of dressing however many trials in this field are very small.

The psychological measures completed by children were the impact of bedwetting and Coopersmith self-esteem scales. Parents completed the maternal tolerance scale.\n                No significant intervention effect was found for any of the outcome measures recorded during treatment, at discharge or six-months post discharge.\n                Multimedia educational programs and written leaflets are widely used to enable children to learn more about their health-related conditions. However, our result suggests that multimedia is no more effective than traditional materials at effecting health-related behavioural change. Three variations in the mode of delivery of Dry Bed Training as a treatment for nocturnal enuresis were investigated. Twenty-three children, ranging in age from 4 to 14, received dry bed training without the additional use of a urine alarm. Treatment variations included: (a) in-home training of parents and child, (b) office based training of parents and child, and (c) office based training of parents only. An additional 7 children served as a waiting list control during the first 8 weeks of the study. A wide variety of outcome measures showed improvement for the entire sample regardless of specific mode of delivery. Implications for the treatment of enuresis using dry bed training and a number of critical methodological issues are discussed. This study compared the effectiveness of the enuresis alarm alone with a brief version of Dry Bed Training in treating 74 enuretic children. Both procedures were equally effective, and in the total sample a better response to treatment was predicted by the child's report of being teased by siblings. Maternal anger was associated with a greater drop-out rate. Treatment of childhood enuresis requires a careful anamnesis, physical examination, urinalysis, and urine culture to determine if a subject is affected with functional or organic enuresis. Functional enuresis (FE) was present in the majority of our patients (168/204). These 168 subjects, aged from 6 to 11 years, were randomly divided into three therapy groups (pharmacological therapy, behavioral therapy, and behavioral therapy with the aid of a personal computer). Our study shows that behavioral therapy gave better results in FE than did pharmacological therapy. We point out the usefulness of combining bladder retention training and behavioral therapy to improve the general maturity and autonomous behavior of the child, and the resultant positive effects on his personality. Two studies examined the effectiveness of the body-worn alarm in out-patient treatment of childhood nocturnal enuresis. The first involved 40 children, previously untreated by conditioning methods, treated with either the body-worn alarm or the traditional pad and bell alarm. The second study compared the body-worn alarm with modified dry-bed training with 48 children previously resistant to treatment. Results of both studies indicated the body-worn alarm was as effective as other methods in terms of the proportion of children successfully treated and was superior with respect to rapidity of response and consumer appeal. Such findings indicate that the body-worn alarm could become the treatment of choice for nocturnal enuresis.",
        "target_summary": "Although DBT and FSHT were better than no treatment when used in combination with an alarm, there was insufficient evidence to support their use without an alarm. An alarm on its own was also better than DBT on its own, but there was some evidence that combining an alarm with DBT was better than an alarm on its own, suggesting that DBT may augment the effect of an alarm. There was also some evidence that direct contact with a therapist might enhance the effects of an intervention.",

Barrier contraception or abstinence was used by controls.\n                The main outcome measures are serum estradiol and progesterone levels and urinary estradiol and pregnanediol levels obtained during the luteal phase before, 1 year and 2 years after sterilization.\n                The women randomized to the bipolar cautery group had higher midluteal progesterone levels measured between Days 5 and 11 postovulation (15.5 ng/mL before sterilization, 14.5 ng/mL at 1 year and 14.5 ng/mL at 2 years) than did the other two groups. The clip group had progesterone levels of 14.1, 12.0 and 12.5 ng/mL at baseline, 1 year and 2 years, respectively, and the control group had levels of 12.0, 11.9 and 11.3 ng/mL for the same periods. Serum estradiol and progesterone and urinary pregnanediol and estradiol were not significantly changed over the 2-year period, nor were there significant differences between the two groups.\n                There were no significant hormonal changes in sterilized women over a period of 2 years when compared with their baseline levels or when compared with unsterilized age-matched controls. A prospective, randomized study of 365 women undergoing interval laparoscopic tubal sterilization in a residency training program was undertaken to compare method failures. Two occlusive techniques were compared, the spring-loaded clip (Hulka-Clemens) and the tubal ring (Falope Ring). Patients were randomized to either Falope Rings or Hulka-Clemens clips as the primary method. Demographic characteristics, educational level and operator experience were similar in the two groups. Follow-up at an average of 16 months (range, 6-24) revealed eight pregnancies (4.5%) in 176 women in the clip group and five pregnancies (2.6%) in the ring group. The Hulka-Clemens clip and the Falope Ring have similar incidences of method failure when employed by inexperienced operators. We question the usefulness of chromopertubation utilizing methylene blue dye to ensure proper placement of the occlusive device. To compare, by conducting a randomized trial, Filshie clip and Pomeroy techniques for postpartum and intrapartum cesarean sterilizations in a United States teaching hospital with respect to surgeon preference and perioperative outcomes.\n                Thirty-two obstetric patients consented for sterilization were randomized to Pomeroy technique or Filshie clip placement. Following the surgical procedure, surgeons and operating room technicians completed a survey regarding their experience with the procedures and preference. Patient demographic data, time for procedure and follow-up visits were obtained by chart review.\n                For most postpartum sterilizations, the mean duration of the procedure was almost 7 min faster for the Filshie clip technique (p = 0.08); perioperative outcomes were equivalent (p = 0.05). Application of the Filshie clip was rated easier than Pomeroy suture application and, overall, the Filshie clip sterilization procedure was rated less difficult (p = 0.03). Seventy percent of surgeons preferred the Filshie clip technique and would choose it if only one postpartum sterilization method was available.\n                For obstetric sterilization, surgeons preferred the Filshie clip over the Pomeroy technique. In addition, operating time was shorter for the Filshie clip. This pilot study suggests that use of the Filshie clip technique has the potential to establish a new standard of care for postpartum and intrapartum cesarean sterilization. The spring-loaded clip and tubal ring techniques of laparoscopic female sterilization were compared for ease of performance, safety and effectiveness at the Asociaci\u00f3n Demogr\u00e1fica Salvadore\u00f1a in San Salvador, where they were randomly assigned to a total of 299 patients. Rates of technical/equipment difficulties and procedural difficulties during laparoscopy were similar for both techniques. Procedure-related surgical complications occurred in three ring patients as a result of tubal transection. Pain during the procedure was more severe for tubal ring patients. Results suggest that both techniques can be safely and effectively used for laparoscopic sterilization. A prospective randomized comparison of the peri-operative complications and long-term sequelae between the Filshie clip and Pomeroy methods was undertaken in 200 postpartum women at Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. The peri-operative complications in either group were mild and infrequent. One pregnancy in the Pomeroy group was reported after follow-up for 24 months. No significant difference between the two groups was found in respect to long-term sequelae. Studies of application of the Rocket clip compared with the tubal ring were conducted at three sites. Procedures were randomly assigned to the patients; 332 women were sterilized with the tubal ring and 331 were sterilized with the Rocket clip. The occlusion devices were applied via a minilaparotomy incision. Surgical difficulties and injuries and technical failures occurred with comparable frequency in the two groups. There were two method failures in each tubal occlusion group; the 24-month life-table pregnancy rate was 1.0 per 100 women in the tubal ring group and 0.9 per 100 in the Rocket clip group. The Rocket spring-loaded clip appears to be as safe, effective, and easy to apply as the tubal ring for tubal occlusion. Three methods of tubal sterilisation, viz. laparoscopy, culdoscopy and minilaparotomy, were evaluated in a trial involving 300 voluntary acceptors at the University Hospital in Medan, Indonesia. Equal numbers of women were randomly assigned to the three surgical groups. The results showed little differences among patients in the three groups for age, number of living children, contraceptive and abortion histories and pre-existing medical conditions. As expected, average surgical time for minilaparotomy was significantly higher than the times reported for the endoscopic techniques. Minilaparotomy also produced the highest incidence of operative complications while culdoscopy accounted for the highest rate of hospitalisation following operation. Four-year follow-up of the patients revealed only one case of pregnancy in the culdoscopy group, three years after tubectomy .",

The clinical effects were compared.\n                The total effective rate was 76.92% in the carbogen group and 50.00% in the control group. The difference was significant between the two groups. The recovery time in the carbogen group was 3-14 days while in the control group was 6-23 days.\n                The efficiency of carbogen ombined with drugs is superior to drug therapeutics in the treatment of sudden deafness. Eighty patients with idiopathic sudden deafness existing no longer than 10 days were included in a prospective randomized double-blind study. Patients were treated for 10 days with infusions of either 10% low-molecular weight dextran or the combination of low-molecular weight dextran with naftidrofuryl. Before treatment and after 10 days hearing loss in the affected ear was determined at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 kHz. The mean hearing loss was then calculated as the average from these values. During monotherapy with low-molecular weight dextran the mean hearing loss decreased from 40 to 27 dB compared to 38 to 17 dB when naftidrofuryl treatment was added (p < 0.01 between groups). A significant benefit of naftidrofuryl on hearing loss was also found at frequencies between 0.5 and 3 kHz. Furthermore, patients reported better improvement of tinnitus when naftidrofuryl was combined with dextran. Two patients receiving dextran alone developed side effects: one had an allergic reaction causing withdrawal of treatment, which the other case had vertigo, nausea and headache with spontaneous recovery. The results of the study showed that treatment with naftidrofuryl in addition to hemodilution with low-molecular weight dextran was of therapeutic benefit in the therapy of sudden deafness without increasing the rate of side effects. The authors conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial for the purpose of elucidating the effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n                With the approval of the institute ethics committee, a total of 57 consecutive patients with diagnoses of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss were included in the study. The patients in the PGE1 group received continuous infusion containing 60 microg PGE1 and 100 mg hydrocortisone for 7 days, and the patients in the placebo group were treated with continuous infusion containing an inactive placebo and 100 mg hydrocortisone.\n                No significant differences were observed in the improvements of pure-tone average and subjective symptoms between the PGE1 and the placebo groups. However, the hearing improvement at high frequencies (4 kHz and 8 kHz) was significantly higher in the PGE1 group than in the placebo group, especially in the patients with severe tinnitus.\n                These results failed to prove a beneficial effect of PGE1 in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Further studies will be needed to clarify the pharmacologic actions of PGE1 in the cochlea.",

        "document": "Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) have a high risk of developing NIDDM. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diet and exercise interventions in those with IGT may delay the development of NIDDM, i.e., reduce the incidence of NIDDM, and thereby reduce the overall incidence of diabetic complications, such as cardiovascular, renal, and retinal disease, and the excess mortality attributable to these complications.\n                In 1986, 110,660 men and women from 33 health care clinics in the city of Da Qing, China, were screened for IGT and NIDDM. Of these individuals, 577 were classified (using World Health Organization criteria) as having IGT. Subjects were randomized by clinic into a clinical trial, either to a control group or to one of three active treatment groups: diet only, exercise only, or diet plus exercise. Follow-up evaluation examinations were conducted at 2-year intervals over a 6-year period to identify subjects who developed NIDDM. Cox's proportional hazard analysis was used to determine if the incidence of NIDDM varied by treatment assignment.\n                The cumulative incidence of diabetes at 6 years was 67.7% (95% CI, 59.8-75.2) in the control group compared with 43.8% (95% CI, 35.5-52.3) in the diet group, 41.1% (95% CI, 33.4-49.4) in the exercise group, and 46.0% (95% CI, 37.3-54.7) in the diet-plus-exercise group (P < 0.05). When analyzed by clinic, each of the active intervention groups differed significantly from the control clinics (P < 0.05). The relative decrease in rate of development of diabetes in the active treatment groups was similar when subjects were stratified as lean or overweight (BMI < or > or = 25 kg/m2). In a proportional hazards analysis adjusted for differences in baseline BMI and fasting glucose, the diet, exercise, and diet-plus-exercise interventions were associated with 31% (P < 0.03), 46% (P < 0.0005), and 42% (P < 0.005) reductions in risk of developing diabetes, respectively.\n                Diet and/or exercise interventions led to a significant decrease in the incidence of diabetes over a 6-year period among those with IGT. To compare and assess the single and joint effect of diet and exercise intervention for 1 year on insulin resistance and the development leading toward the insulin resistance syndrome.\n                An unmasked, randomized 2 x 2 factorial intervention trial was applied with a duration of 1 year for each participant. The trial comprised 219 men and women with diastolic blood pressure of 86-99 mmHg, HDL cholesterol < 1.20 mmol/l, triglycerides > 1.4 mmol/l, total cholesterol of 5.20-7.74 mmol/l, and BMI > 24 kg/m2. Participants were randomly allocated to diet group (n = 35), diet and exercise group (n = 67), exercise group (n = 54), and control group (n = 43). The diet included increased intake of fish and reduced total fat intake. The exercise program entailed supervised endurance exercise three times a week. Baseline cross-sectional changes and 1-year changes in insulin resistance, fasting serum levels of insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, glucose, and lipids as well as weight, mean blood pressure, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) values were recorded.\n                The cross-sectional results at baseline showed significant correlations between the calculated insulin resistance and BMI (r = 0.54) and correlations between the mean blood pressure (mBP) (r = 0.26) and PAI-1 (r = 0.40). The 1-year diet intervention gave a significant decrease in the calculated insulin resistance from 4.6 to 4.2 and a positive correlation between the changes in insulin resistance and changes in BMI (r = 0.40). The diet and exercise intervention also led to significantly decreased insulin resistance (from 5.0 to 4.0). The exercise intervention did not significantly change insulin resistance.\n                The cross-sectional and 1-year intervention results supported each other and underscored the important connection between increased BMI and the development leading toward the insulin resistance syndrome.",

In an uncontrolled study, 80 percent of 32 patients with active ulcerative colitis refractory to corticosteroid therapy had a response to cyclosporine therapy.\n                We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in which cyclosporine (4 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) or placebo was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to 20 patients with severe ulcerative colitis whose condition had not improved after at least 7 days of intravenous corticosteroid therapy. A response to therapy was defined as an improvement in a numerical symptom score (0 indicated no symptoms, and 21 severe symptoms) leading to discharge from the hospital and treatment with oral medications. Failure to respond to therapy resulted in colectomy, but some patients in the placebo group who had no response and no urgent need for surgery were subsequently treated with cyclosporine.\n                Nine of 11 patients (82 percent) treated with cyclosporine had a response within a mean of seven days, as compared with 0 of 9 patients who received placebo (P < 0.001). The mean clinical-activity score fell from 13 to 6 in the cyclosporine group, as compared with a decrease from 14 to 13 in the placebo group. All five patients in the placebo group who later received cyclosporine therapy had a response.\n                Intravenous cyclosporine therapy is rapidly effective for patients with severe corticosteroid-resistant ulcerative colitis. Cyclosporine has been effective in patients with steroid-refractory attacks of ulcerative colitis (UC). We investigated the effects of intravenous (IV) cyclosporine as single IV therapy (without glucocorticosteroids) for severe UC and compared these with the response to glucocorticosteroids.\n                Patients with a severe attack of UC were randomized to treatment with IV cyclosporine, 4 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1), or with methylprednisolone, 40 mg/day, in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. After 8 days, patients who had a response received the same medication orally in combination with azathioprine. Patients were followed up clinically, endoscopically, and by scintigraphy. Renal function was assessed using urinary inulin clearances. Endpoints were clinical improvement, discharge from the hospital, and remission up to 12 months after intravenous therapy.\n                Thirty patients were included. After 8 days, 8 of 15 patients (53%) who received methylprednisolone had a response to therapy vs. 9 of 14 (64%) receiving cyclosporine. In nonresponders, 3 of 7 methylprednisolone patients and 1 of 3 cyclosporine patients improved when both treatments were combined. No serious drug-related toxicity was observed with either treatment. At 12 months, 7 of 9 patients (78%) initially controlled with cyclosporine maintained their remission vs. 3 of 8 (37%) initially treated with methylprednisolone. No clinically significant decrease of renal function was observed.\n                Cyclosporine monotherapy is an effective and safe alternative to glucocorticosteroids in patients with severe attacks of UC.",

        "document": "A total of 110 infants born to mothers who were either in a methadone maintenance program, using heroin, or recently detoxified, were studied during the neonatal period. Of these infants, 93.6 per cent developed withdrawal symptoms. No significant differences were determined in therapeutic response among those infants treated with methadone, phenobarbital, and diazepam. There was a significant reduction in the frequency of withdrawal symptoms among infants born to mothers whose methadone dose at time of delivery was less than 20 mg (17.9 per cent). It is suggested that reduction of methadone dosage in late pregnancy results in reduced incidence of withdrawal but must be carefully carried out. To determine if oral clonidine would reduce the duration of opioid detoxification for neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n                Infants with intrauterine exposure to methadone or heroin and neonatal abstinence syndrome (2 consecutive modified Finnegan scores of > or =9) were enrolled at 2 hospitals during 2002-2005 and followed until final hospital discharge. All enrolled infants (80) received oral diluted tincture of opium according to a standardized algorithm and were randomly assigned to receive oral clonidine (1 microg/kg every 4 hours) (40 infants) or placebo (40 infants). Primary outcome was duration of opioid therapy. Secondary outcomes included the amount of opium required to control symptoms, number of treatment failures, and differences in blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.\n                The median length of therapy was 27% shorter in the clonidine group (11 [95% confidence interval: 8-15 days]) than in the placebo group (15 days [95% confidence interval: 12-17 days]). In the clonidine group, 7 infants required restarting opium after initial discontinuation versus none in the placebo group, with the total length of treatment/observation remaining significantly less in the clonidine group. Higher dosages of opium were required by 40% of the infants in the placebo group versus 20% in the clonidine group. Treatment failures occurred in 12.5% of the infants in the placebo group versus none in the clonidine group. Hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, or desaturations did not occur in either group. Three infants in the clonidine group died as a result of myocarditis, sudden infant death syndrome, and homicide, all after hospital discharge and before 6 months of age.\n                In this randomized, double-blind trial, adding clonidine to standard opioid therapy for detoxification from in utero exposure to methadone or heroin reduced the duration of pharmacotherapy for neonatal abstinence without causing short-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes. A larger trial is indicated to determine long-term safety. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that treatment of neonatal opiate withdrawal (NOW) in the term infant with diluted tincture of opium (DTO) and phenobarbital was superior to treatment with DTO alone. Study design: This was a partially randomized, controlled trial in which 20 term infants exposed to methadone and/or heroin in utero were studied. The severity of NOW was assessed by using the Finnegan scoring system. Infants were assigned to either DTO and placebo (n = 10) or DTO and phenobarbital (n = 10) when medication was required. The primary outcome variable was the duration of hospitalization. Severity of withdrawal and hospital cost were secondary outcome variables.\n                There were no significant differences in the gestational age, growth variables, maternal methadone dose, or age at enrollment between the 2 groups. The duration of hospitalization was reduced by 48% (79-38 days) (P <.001) and hospital cost per patient reduced by $35,856 (P <.001) for the DTO and phenobarbital group. Furthermore, these infants spent less time with severe withdrawal (P <.04), more time with mild withdrawal (P <.03), and required a lower maximum daily DTO dose (P <.009) when compared with the DTO-only group. The average duration of outpatient phenobarbital use was 3.5 months.\n                The combined use of DTO and phenobarbital resulted in a shorter duration of hospitalization, less severe withdrawal, and reduced hospital cost. This combination may be a preferred regimen for the treatment of NOW. The majority of infants born to drug-dependent women undergo neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and often require pharmacotherapy for the treatment of withdrawal symptoms. Phenobarbital, paregoric, and diazepam have been recommended for the treatment of the syndrome. While some investigators have examined the efficacy of these agents in treating NAS, there are no data regarding the use of specific pharmacologic agents and developmental outcome. This study evaluated 85 infants born to drug-dependent women who were maintained on methadone during pregnancy. Severity of infant withdrawal was assessed with the neonatal abstinence scoring system. Infants who required pharmacotherapy were randomly assigned to one of four treatment regimens: paragoric, phenobarbital (titration), phenobarbital (loading), and diazepam. When treatment was not successful with the assigned agent, one of the other agent(s) was used. At 6 months of age, the developmental status of infants was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Mental Development. Based on NAS treatment, four groups were defined: paregoric (n = 21); phenobarbital (n = 17); more than one agent (n = 31); and no treatment (n = 16). Data for the phenobarbital loading and titration groups were combined since analysis revealed no differences between groups. All infants who initially received diazepam were included in group III since diazepam as a single agent was not successful. Results of one way analysis of variance revealed no differences in developmental status between groups (p greater than 0.10, F = 0.25). Scores for all groups were well within the normal range of development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Where a sedative is used, phenobarbitone should be used in preference to diazepam. In infants treated with an opiate, the addition of phenobarbitone or clonidine may reduce withdrawal severity. Further studies are needed to determine the role of sedatives in infants with NAS due to opiate withdrawal and the safety and efficacy of adding phenobarbitone or clonidine in infants treated with an opiate for NAS.",

        "document": "The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of total intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) versus total continuous androgen deprivation (CAD) for treating patients with advanced prostate cancer in a phase III randomized trial. A total of 68 evaluable patients with hormone-naive advanced or relapsing prostate cancer were randomized to receive combined androgen blockade according to a continuous (n = 33) or intermittent (n = 35) regimen. Therapeutic monitoring was assessed by use of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements. Patients in the CAD and IAD groups were equally stratified for age, biopsy Gleason score, and baseline serum PSA levels. The outcome variable was time to androgen-independence of the tumor, which was defined as increasing serum PSA levels despite androgen blockade. Mean follow-up was 30.8 months. The 35 IAD-treated patients completed 91 cycles, and 19 of them (54.3%) completed > or = 3 cycles. Median cycle length and percentage of time off therapy were 9.0 months and 59.5, respectively. The estimated 3-year progression rate was significantly lower in the IAD group (7.0% +/- 4.8%) than in the CAD group (38.9% +/- 11.2%, P = 0.0052). Our data suggest that IAD treatment may maintain the androgen-dependent state of advanced human prostate cancer, as assessed by PSA measurements, at least as long as CAD treatment. Further studies with longer follow-up times and larger patient cohorts are needed to determine the comparative impacts of CAD and IAD on survival.

Patients were registered as primary candidates of the study and were treated with 6 months of LHRH agonist, with short-term of antiandrogen treatment for flare-up prevention. Patients with PSA levels below 10 ng/ml after the 6-month endocrine treatment were randomly divided into two arms. Then, a total dose of 72 Gy was given to the prostate. After 14 months of the protocol treatment, patients were treated with continuous androgen ablation (arm 1) or intermittent androgen ablation (arm 2).\n                A total of 188 cases (87%) remained in the protocol. The median PSA level at entry was 25.3 ng/ml. The Gleason score was 2-6 in 32 cases (16%), 7 in 94 cases (48%), and 8-10 in 68 cases (35%). The median PSA level showed a remarkable decrease to 1.1, 0.2, and 0.1 ng/ml, after 6, 8, and 14 months of the protocol treatment, respectively. Of the 157 cases treated with EBRT, 153 cases (97.5%) had no biochemical failure in the mean follow-up of 17.3 months.\n                The present study may reveal the possibilities of intermittent endocrine therapy after EBRT.

The study was performed as a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial of 10 days with doses of propranolol, 80 mg twice a day, pindolol, 5 mg twice a day, labetalol, 200 mg twice a day, and labetalol, 400 mg twice a day as active drug. Heart rate was lowest during propranolol dosing and blood pressure was lowest during labetalol dosing irrespective of the labetalol dose used. The degree of peripheral arterial disease modulated the effect of beta-blockade on limb circulation. In the less symptomatic limbs, reactive hyperemic flow was greater after pindolol than after the other drugs and did not differ from the level recorded after placebo. These differences were inconsistent and small in the more symptomatic limbs. Thus as the peripheral arterial disease became more severe and extensive, beta-blockade, irrespective of its type, lost its hemodynamic effect on lower limb circulation. To determine the effects of the beta 1 selective adrenoceptor blocker atenolol, the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nifedipine, and the combination of atenolol plus nifedipine on objective and subjective measures of walking performance and foot temperature in patients with intermittent claudication.\n                Randomised controlled double blind four way crossover trial.\n                Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield.\n                49 patients (40 men) aged 39-70 with chronic stable intermittent claudication.\n                Atenolol 50 mg twice daily; slow release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily; atenolol 50 mg plus slow release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily; placebo. Each treatment was given for four weeks with no washout interval between treatments.\n                Claudication and walking distances on treadmill; skin temperature of feet as measured by thermistor and probe; blood pressure before and after exercise; subjective assessments of walking difficulty and foot coldness with visual analogue scales.\n                Atenolol did not significantly alter claudication distance (mean change -6%; 95% confidence interval 1% to -13%), walking distance (-2%; 4% to -8%), or foot temperature. Nifedipine did not alter claudication distance (-4%; 3% to -11%), walking distance (-4%; 3% to -10%), or foot temperature. Atenolol plus nifedipine did not alter claudication distance but significantly reduced walking distance (-9%; -3% to -15% (p less than 0.003)) and skin temperature of the more affected foot (-1.1 degrees C; 0 to -2.2 degrees C (p = 0.05)). These effects on walking distance and foot temperature seemed unrelated to blood pressure changes.\n                There was no evidence of adverse or beneficial effects of atenolol or nifedipine, when given singly, on peripheral vascular disease. The combined treatment, however, affected walking ability and foot temperature adversely. This may have been due to beta blockade plus reduced vascular resistance, which might also explain the reported adverse effects of pindolol and labetalol on claudication. In a placebo-controlled double-blind study 14 hypertensive patients with intermittent claudication were treated with metoprolol (100-200 mg daily) and methyldopa (500-1000 mg daily) for 3 weeks and their effects on heart rate, blood pressure as well as on resting and hyperaemic calf blood flow and vascular resistance were compared. In their antihypertensive effect metoprolol and methyldopa did not differ significantly. In 23 diseased limbs the calf blood flow and vascular resistance remained unchanged at rest during the trial. The active drugs reduced hyperaemic flow (P less than 0.05). The peak flow was reduced by 20% (P greater than 0.01) with metoprolol and by 15% with methyldopa below the initial level and by 17% and by 12% below the level recorded on placebo, respectively. Neither of the drugs influenced vascular resistance during reactive hyperaemia. Thus, in patients with intermittent claudication antihypertensives should be used with care. Beta-Adrenergic blockers have not been widely used in patients with peripheral vascular disease because these drugs have been reported to worsen the symptoms of intermittent claudication. To test this assumption we studied the effects of a beta 1-selective and a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker on postexercise calf blood flow and symptoms of claudication in 19 patients with mild-to-moderate peripheral vascular disease. Subjects received placebo for 3 weeks, and then were randomized to 120 mg/day propranolol or 150 mg/day metoprolol with the use of a crossover design. Blood flow in the calf was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography at rest and immediately after exercise on a bicycle ergometer at a low and a high workload. The symptoms of claudication were monitored during bicycle exercise and by patient diaries maintained between visits. Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced an equivalent amount by metoprolol (19 beats/min) and propranolol (16 beats/min). Mean arterial pressure was reduced by propranolol at rest and by both drugs with exercise. Calf blood flow was not affected by either drug compared with placebo at rest or at either workload. In addition, the symptoms of claudication were not worsened by either drug. We conclude that despite evidence of beta 1-adrenergic blockade and a lowering of arterial pressure, neither beta-adrenergic blocker adversely affected the peripheral circulation.",

        "document": "Although dihydrocodeine (DF118) is widely prescribed by general dental practitioners, there is little evidence that it is successful in controlling post-operative dental pain. Ibuprofen is known to be effective in this situation. A single dose, double-blind study was carried out in 148 patients to compare 400 mg ibuprofen with 30 mg dihydrocodeine and placebo for treating moderate to severe pain following the removal of unilateral, impacted mandibular third molar teeth under local anaesthesia. An additional dose of either ibuprofen or dihydrocodeine was available after 2 hours. The post-operative ibuprofen reduced pain and produced more pain relief than dihydrocodeine or placebo. Furthermore, fewer patients receiving ibuprofen took additional analgesic at 2 hours. Patients who received ibuprofen as supplementary medication also experienced less pain and had greater pain relief than those receiving dihydrocodeine as supplementary medication, even when their post-operative treatment had been placebo. More patients reported the medication as having been effective if they took ibuprofen either post-operatively or as supplementary analgesia. Ibuprofen is an appropriate analgesic for treating post-operative dental pain. The objectives were to compare the relative merits of ibuprofen 400 mg and dihydrocodeine 30 mg or 60 mg taken up to four times daily for up to 6 days in the treatment of pain after third molar removal. A randomised, double-blind, multiple dose, crossover study was undertaken in 68 patients undergoing two-stage bilateral lower third molar removal. The results showed that ibuprofen produced significantly greater analgesia than either of the dihydrocodeine treatments on the day of surgery. Ibuprofen and dihydrocodeine 60 mg produced significantly greater analgesia than dihydrocodeine 30 mg on the day after surgery, and on days 4 and 5 ibuprofen was again significantly superior to dihydrocodeine 60 mg. Roughly half the patients taking dihydrocodeine stopped the study on the day after surgery, because of adverse effects and/or inadequate relief, compared with 6 out of 44 taking ibuprofen. Dihydrocodeine 60 mg produced four times the number of patients affected by adverse effects compared with ibuprofen, and dihydrocodeine 30 mg three times as many. The principal adverse effects were nausea, vomiting and drowsiness. In conclusion, ibuprofen produced better analgesia than dihydrocodeine with significantly fewer adverse effects and is therefore a better choice for pain relief after oral surgery. Zomepirac 100 mg and dihydrocodeine 30 mg were compared with placebo in a controlled randomized, double-blind, single-dose postoperative study. Patients continued to receive either zomepirac or dihydrocodeine for pain relief for 5 days at home in a double-blind study, being allowed to titrate the consumption of tablets to their degree of pain. The efficacy and side effects of the medication were evaluated. In the single-dose phase, both active treatments were significantly better than placebo. In the multiple dosing phase, zomepirac was statistically better than dihydrocodeine. Non-parametric statistical tests indicated highly significant correlations between single- and multiple-dose analgesic measurements for both zomepirac and dihydrocodeine.",

        "document": "In a randomized double-blind study the clinical efficacy of the calcium channel blocker, diltiazem was compared to that of a placebo on the clinical course of Duchenne's dystrophy (DMD) over a 12-month period. Altogether 30 patients, mostly in an advanced state of the disease, were evaluated. The 17 patients in the diltiazem group received 90-360 mg diltiazem per day according to their body weight; the 13 patients of the placebo group received the equivalent amount of a placebo. No significant difference was detected between the two groups regarding muscular power, muscle state, muscular functional ability (Vignos), serum myoglobin and serum creative phosphokinase. Twenty-seven boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) entered a double-blind controlled trial of treatment with the calcium antagonist flunarizine. They were matched for age and disability. At monthly intervals, muscle power, functional ability, locomotor score, contractures, and forced vital capacity were measured by a team not involved in clinical care. Over a period of 1 year, flunarizine in a dose of up to 0.25 mg/kg/day had no effect on the clinical course of the disease. Excessive accumulation of intracellular calcium in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) may be a necessary step in the process that causes muscle damage in this disease. Because of this possibility, a controlled trial of the calcium channel blocking agent nifedipine was undertaken. One hundred and five patients were randomized and treated in a double-blind manner for 18 months. Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability, cardiopulmonary changes, and laboratory data were monitored. The dose of nifedipine was 0.75-1 mg/kg/day in the first 6 months and 1.5-2 mg/kg/day for the next 12 months. Satisfactory blood levels of nifedipine were attained. The study had a power greater than 0.99 to detect a slowing of the illness to 25% of its original rate of progression. No significant improvement was demonstrated in the treated group. One or more of the frequent mild side effects of flushing, dizziness, and leg edema, often associated with the use of nifedipine in adults, occurred transiently in approximately one-half of the patients in the nifedipine group and in 21% of the placebo group. Four patients died, two on nifedipine and two on placebo. This study demonstrates that nifedipine is safe to administer in children, but that it is without beneficial effect on the course of DMD. The role of calcium accumulation in the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has already been discussed. Several trials with different calcium-blocking drugs have revealed no clinical benefit. In addition, the present study includes histological investigations and computer tomography to verify therapeutic effects. In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study, 13 DMD patients aged from 3-10 years (mean, 7 years) were treated with 5 mg/kg diltiazem daily for 1 year. Compared with before therapy, the number of calcium-positive muscular fibres was remarkably reduced in the treated DMD patients, but not in the placebo group. The evaluation of all other biochemical and clinical parameters revealed no significant effects of the diltiazem therapy. The muscular X-ray density measured by computer tomography decreased under treatment. After the evaluation of the double-blind study, the code was broken. Therapy, however, was continued in the treated group and started in the placebo group. After 3 years of diltiazem therapy the clinical status of all 26 patients of the study and 20 additional DMD patients who were treated with diltiazem was compared with 46 untreated DMD patients of the same age and stage in our department. No obvious clinical benefit of diltiazem therapy could be observed.",

        "document": "Recent articles have suggested that muscle biofeedback and transcendental meditation may be useful in treating chronic anxiety. To assess this, we conducted a controlled study comparing muscle biofeedback, transcendental mediation, and relaxation therapy. The study consisted of a six-week baseline period, six weeks of treatment, a six-week posttreatment observation period, and later follow-up. Thirty-one subjects completed the first part of the study and have been followed up for three to 18 months. Forty percent of the subjects had a clinically significant decrease in their anxiety. There were no differences between treatments with respect to treatment efficacy, onset of symptom amelioration, or maintenance of therapeutic gains. We found no evidence suggesting that the degree of muscle relaxation induced by any of the treatments is related to the therapeutic outcome. Relaxation therapies as a sole treatment appear to have a limited place in the treatment of chronic anxiety. The objective of this study was to compare efficacy of two meditation protocols for treating patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Patients were randomized to two groups-matched for sex, age, and medication status-and blinded to the comparison protocol. They were told the trial would last for 12 months, unless one protocol proved to be more efficacious. If so, groups would merge, and the group that received the less efficacious treatment would also be afforded 12 months of the more effective one. The study was conducted at Children's Hospital, San Diego, Calif. Patients were selected according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition-Revised (DSM-III-R) criteria and recruited by advertisements and referral. At baseline, Group 1 included 11 adults and 1 adolescent, and Group 2 included 10 adults. Group 1 employed a kundalini yoga meditation protocol and Group 2 employed the Relaxation Response plus Mindfulness Meditation technique. Baseline and 3-month interval testing was conducted using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised Obsessive Compulsive (SCL-90-R OC) and Global Severity Index (SCL-90-R GSI) scales, Profile of Moods scale (POMS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Purpose in Life (PIL) test. Seven adults in each group completed 3 months of therapy. At 3 months, Group 1 demonstrated greater improvements (Student's independent groups t-test) on the Y-BOCS, SCL-90-R OC and GSI scales, and POMS, and greater but nonsignificant improvements on the PSS and PIL test. An intent-to-treat analysis (Y-BOCS) for the baseline and 3-month tests showed that only Group 1 improved. Within-group statistics (Student's paired t-tests) showed that Group 1 significantly improved on all six scales, but Group 2 had no improvements. Groups were merged for an additional year using Group 1 techniques. At 15 months, the final group (N=11) improved 71%, 62%, 66%, 74%, 39%, and 23%, respectively, on the Y-BOCS, SCL-90-R OC, SCL-90-R GSI, POMS, PSS, and PIL; P<0.003 (analysis of variance).

The laser protocol consisted of three treatments weekly using a cluster probe with an 820-nm laser diode and 30 superluminous diodes (10 each at 660, 880, and 950 nm), and energy density of 4J/cm2, and a pulse repetition rate of 5,000 pulses per second. The US/UVC regimen consisted of five treatments weekly, alternating the treatment modality daily. The pulsed US was applied at a frequency of 3 MHz and a spatial average-temporal average intensity of 0.2 W/cm2 (1:4 pulse ratio) for 5 minutes per 5 cm2 of wound area. The UVC dosage (95% emission at 250 nm) was calculated each session according to wound appearance. The dosage level was E1 for clean/granulating areas, E3 for purulent/slow-granulating areas, E4 for heavily infected areas, and 2E4 for wound debridement.

In our previous studies a single dose (6 mumol/kg birth weight) significantly moderated hyperbilirubinemia and reduced phototherapy (PT) time by > 75% when administered within 24 hours of birth to preterm infants.\n                To directly compare the efficacy of SnMP and PT for controlling hyperbilirubinemia in term and near-term infants.\n                Two randomized, sequentially analyzed trials (Study I: male term infants; Study II: infants of both sexes and gestational age [GA] 245-265 days) were conducted. SnMP (6 mumol/kg birth weight) or PT (Phillips F20T12/BB lamps) was administered to paired infants according to strict criteria of plasma bilirubin levels and age. Time of enrollment and closure of cases and crossover, if necessary, of SnMP infants to PT or all infants to exchange transfusion were precisely defined in each pair. SnMP or PT was considered superior if the time between enrollment and closure of the case was reduced by > 24 hours over the alternative treatment or if crossover had occurred.\n                None of the 44 SnMP-treated infants required supplemental PT. Of the 22 pairs of term infants enrolled in Study I, SnMP proved superior to PT in 20 and equal in two. Of the 20 pairs of near-term infants enrolled in Study II, SnMP was superior in 12 and PT in two; six were tied. Two SnMP-treated infants were unpaired. The PT-treated infants in Study I required an average of 33 hours of treatment; those in Study II, 48 hours.

The infants' PBCs were followed by daily measurements either in the hospital or at discharge as outpatients until the hyperbilirubinemia had subsided (PBC </=222.3 micromol/L [13mg/dL]). The total number of newborns enrolled in the study was 84; the SnMP group comprised 40 infants; the control group comprised 44 infants. The groups were similar in sex ratio, birth weight, gestational age, PBC, and age at enrollment. All infants were breastfed. Phototherapy was initiated at a PBC of 333.5 micromol/dL (19.5 mg/dL).\n                SnMP entirely eliminated the need for supplemental PT to control hyperbilirubinemia; in contrast, of the 44 control infants, 12 required treatment with PT (27%) when their PBC reached or exceeded the level (333.5 micromol/dL; 19.5 mg/dL) at which time the use of PT was dictated by hospital guidelines. None of the 40 SnMP-treated infants reached a PBC of 19.5 mg/dL. SnMP also markedly diminished the median hours to case closure (SnMP: median, 86.5 hours; minimum/maximum, 24/216 hours; controls: median, 120 hours; minimum/maximum, 72/336 hours); and significantly reduced the number of bilirubin determinations required for clinical monitoring of the infants (SnMP: median, 3; minimum/maximum, 1/9; controls: median, 5; minimum/maximum, 3/11). No adverse effects of SnMP use were observed.\n                A single dose of SnMP proved effective in controlling severe hyperbilirubinemia in full-term breastfed newborns with high bilirubin levels between 48 and 96 hours.

In the group receiving the high-dose intravenous regimen, mean high and low quinine concentrations were consistently greater than 10 and 6.5 mg/l, respectively. Peak concentrations as well as the time required to achieve them were similar in the intramuscular and high-dose intravenous groups. The low-dose intravenous quinine regimen resulted in mean peak concentrations greater than 6 mg/l and mean low concentrations greater than 3.5 mg/l. All blood concentrations exceeded the 99% in vitro inhibitory concentration (EC99) of 0.89 mg/l or less of quinine for 60 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum, which were taken from children with malaria during the same period. Judged by a number of clinical criteria, the response was better in patients receiving the high-dose than the low-dose intravenous regimen. The time taken to clear parasites with both the high-dose intravenous and intramuscular regimens were significantly shorter than those obtained in the low-dose group. We have also shown for the first time that the rate of parasite clearance can be directly related to the area under the quinine concentration versus time curve. This applied to all three quinine regimens (r = 0.4252, P less than 0.02; n less than or equal to 35). Five patients, two on the low-dose regimen, two on the intramuscular regimen, and one on the high-dose regimen, developed hypoglycemia after admission, but in these cases, insulin concentrations were correspondingly low.

Quinine formiate was administered to a group of 35 patients in an initial loading dose of 20 mg salt/kg (equivalent to 17.5 mg/kg of the base) in 10 mL/kg of 5% glucose over four hours, followed eight hours later by a maintenance dose quinine of 10 mg salt/kg (equivalent to 8.7 mg/kg of the base) dissolved in 15 mL/kg of 5% glucose over and every 12 hours. The second group of 37 patients received intravenous quinine 15 mg salt/kg (13.1 mg of base) dissolved in 15 mL/kg of 5% glucose infused over 6 to 8 hours, every 12 hours. In both groups this treatment was continued until the patient could swallow, then quinine tablets were given to complete seven days treatment. The assessment of cardiovascular side effects was made by an ECG at admission, the 4th hour, the 24th hour and at the end of treatment for each patient.\n                Coma mean durations were similar in the two groups: 35.5 +/- 17.8 hours and 28.6 +/- 14.4 hours respectively for the loading dose group and the group without loading dose. The two groups were comparable also for the decrease evolution of parasitemia. Case-fatality rates were also similar: 95% of healing at the 72nd hour and a lethality rate between 5 and 6% in the two groups. But a significant increase of the body temperature was noted between the 51st and the 63rd hour in the group without loading dose. No significant cardiovascular toxicity was noticed in the two groups. The mean cost of the loading dose regimen was less than that of the second regimen.\n                The loading dose regimen of quinine is well tolerated and it seemed slightly more effective than the regimen without loading dose. In cases of contra-indications (patients who recently received quinine, mefloquine or halofantrine), regimens without loading dose, which remains effective, should be used. From July 1989 to February 1990, 17 non-pregnant patients with severe falciparum malaria, aged 14 years and above received an initial intravenous quinine dihydrochloride loading dose of 20 mg/kg in 500 mls of normal saline or 5% dextrose infused over 4 hours followed by 100mg/kg infused 8 hourly for at least 24 hours. Sixteen comparable controls were similarly treated but without an initial loading dose. Oral quinine bisulfate 10mg/kg 8 hourly was substituted for a total of 7 days when patients were well enough. There was no significant difference in clinical and parasitological response between the two groups. Fever clearance time in hours was 44.00 +/- 13.92 (mean +/- SD) in the study group and 51.43 +/- 19.63 (mean +/- SD) in the control group (p > 0.05). Parasite clearance time in hours was 42.40 +/- 9.75 (mean +/- SD) in the study group and 47.05 +/- 7.69 (mean +/- SD) in the control group (p > 0.05). One patient from each group died. Mild toxic effects were common in both groups. Transient partial hearing loss occurred significantly more in the study than control group (p < 0.05). Hypoglycaemia during treatment occurred in 3 (18%) patients in the study group and 1 (6%) in the control group. The mean trough and peak plasma quinine levels in 3 patients per group was persistently higher than 9mg/L after first infusion. We conclude that though fairly well tolerated, quinine loading dose appears to have no advantage over the standard treatment for severe falciparum malaria at Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.",

        "document": "Glass ionomer cement (GIC) has been suggested as an alternative to acrylic resin in bracket bonding because of its fluoride release. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate further the suitability of GIC as a bonding adhesive compared with an acrylic resin with regard to frequency of bracket failure, fracture modes and clean-up time after debonding. Two commercially available brackets were tested, one with a meshed foil base and the other with an integral base. A total of 60 patients, with a mean age of 13 years 7 months (range 10 years 8 months to 19 years 1 month) were consecutively selected. Brackets were bonded with a GIC (AquaCem, De Trey) and a no-mix diacrylate (Unite, Unitek Corp.) according to random assignment for each jaw. One group of patients (n = 30) was bonded with metal brackets with machine cut grooves in the base (DynaLock, Unitek). In the second group (n = 30) brackets with a meshed foil base (Unitwin, Unitek) were used. Bracket failure location during treatment was recorded as were fracture modes and time required for the clean-up of enamel surfaces at debonding. The frequency of failed brackets was higher with GIC (36 per cent) than with the diacrylate (15 per cent). Bracket failures for the cut groove base type occurred in 50 per cent with GIC and 23 per cent with the acrylic, meshed foil bases failed in 22 per cent GIC and in 7 per cent with the acrylic, respectively. The differences in failure between bracket types were significant at P < 0.001 for both bonding materials. Analysis of the fracture modes showed a small but noticeable difference in the strength of adhesion to the enamel surface, favouring GIC. Time required for the clean-up of enamel surfaces showed a significantly shorter debonding time for GIC. It is concluded that the use of a GIC for orthodontic bonding purposes considerably increases the risk of bond failures during treatment, especially in combination with a cut groove base type. One noticeable advantage with GIC bonding, however, is the shorter clean-up time for the enamel surfaces. The study aimed to compare the survival time and cariostatic potential of a compomer to that of a resin adhesive when used to bond stainless steel orthodontic brackets to labial segment teeth only. The effect of the patients' sex, age at the start of treatment and presenting malocclusion on bracket survival time was assessed also. Forty-five consecutive patients who attended for fixed appliance therapy were randomly selected. Four hundred twenty-six brackets were bonded (213 with compomer and 213 with resin adhesive) with a split mouth design; the right or left side allocation of compomer in either arch was alternated. Color transparencies of the maxillary incisors, mandibular incisors, or both, and transparencies of the canines, were taken before treatment. At the debond stage, the transparencies were projected (20x) and assessed by an experienced examiner, who used a caries index. The survival time distributions for brackets bonded with each bonding agent were not significantly different (P = .74, paired Prentice-Wilcoxon test; P = .75, Akritas test), with bracket failure rates of 17% and 20% recorded for compomer and resin adhesive, respectively. Neither the patients' sex (P = .85) nor malocclusion (P = .26) appear to affect significantly bracket survival, but patient age was identified as a useful prognostic indicator of bracket survival (P < .001). On average, there was more decalcification related to brackets bonded with resin adhesive than with compomer (P = .0075). Survival time distributions of brackets bonded with compomer or resin adhesive appear comparable, but decalcification was reduced significantly by bonding with compomer.",

The study group, 91 women, received tranexamic acid immediately before CS whereas the control group, 89 women did not.\n                Blood was collected during two periods. The first period was from placental delivery to the end of CS and the second was from the end of CS to 2 h postpartum. The quantity of blood was measured and compared between the two groups. Complete blood count, urinalysis, liver and renal function, prothrombin time and activity, were tested in the two groups.\n                Tranexamic acid significantly reduced the quantity of blood from the end of CS to 2 h postpartum: 42.75 +/- 40.45 ml in the study group versus 73.98 +/- 77.09 ml in the control group (P=0.001). It also significantly reduced the quantity of total blood from placental delivery to 2 h postpartum: 351.57 +/- 148.20 ml in the study group, 439.36 +/- 191.48 ml in the control group (P=0.002). No complications or side effects were reported in either group.\n                Tranexamic acid statistically reduces the extent of bleeding from placental delivery to 2 h postpartum and its use was not associated with any side effects or complications. Thus, tranexamic acid can be used safely and effectively to reduce bleeding resulting from CS. To study the efficacy and safety of Transamin (tranexamic acid) in reducing postpartum blood loss.\n                Four hundred primipara with term singleton pregnancy, vertex presentation, spontaneous delivery were enrolled. Ten U Oxytocin was injected intravenously immediately after the delivery of fetal shoulders in the second stage of labor. Then all the puerperants were randomly assigned to 4 groups.

Vaginal bleeding was precisely collected, and examined immediately after the expulsion of placenta and from placenta expulsion till 2 hours after delivery. The amount of blood loss was measured by both methods of weight and volume.\n                There were no significant differences of blood loss immediately after the expulsion of placenta among the 4 groups (P > 0.05). For the average blood loss at 2 hour postpartum, it was 129.7 ml, 133.9 ml, 168.5 ml and 178.2 ml for group I, II, II and IV respectively, while the total blood loss for the 4 groups was 243.3 ml, 242.9 ml, 308.1 ml, and 314.8 ml respectively. The average blood loss of group I and II was significantly less than group III and IV (P < 0.01), however, there was no significant difference between group I and group II (P > 0.05). The occurrences of postpartum hemorrhage (blood lose > or = 400 ml) were 6.4%, 13.3%, 20.7% and 25.3% for group I, II, III and IV respectively.

Patients received 2.5-mg tablets for the first 4 weeks, 5.0-mg tablets for the second 4 weeks, and 10.0-mg tablets for the last 4 weeks of the 12-week study. Patients were allowed to titrate pilocarpine or placebo for improvement in symptoms or to reduce side effects. Patients were evaluated for symptomatic relief by questionnaires and visual analog scales (VAS), and for saliva production by sialometry.\n                Pilocarpine produced a significant improvement (P = .035) in overall global assessments compared with placebo. There was a statistically significant (P = .020) decreased use of oral comfort agents such as artificial saliva, hard candy, and water. Values for symptomatic improvement in dryness approached significance (P = .057). There were statistically significant postdose improvements in whole and parotid salivary flow in pilocarpine treatment groups versus placebo. All pilocarpine dosages tested were judged to be safe. Adverse experiences were primarily sweating, rhinitis, headache, nausea, and urinary frequency, with the most common side effect being mild to moderate sweating. There were no serious drug-related adverse experiences in any of the pilocarpine treatment groups.\n                It is concluded that pilocarpine produces clinically significant benefits for the symptomatic treatment of postradiation xerostomia. Best results were obtained with continuous treatment for 8 to 12 weeks with doses greater than 2.5 mg three times per day. Twenty patients with radiation-induced xerostomia were entered into a prospective randomized crossover study comparing a mucin-based artificial saliva (Saliva Orthana) and a mouthwash containing pilocarpine (5 mg three times a day). Overall the patients found that the pilocarpine mouthwash was more effective than the artificial saliva in relieving their symptoms (p = 0.04), and 47 per cent of the patients wanted to continue with this treatment after the study had finished. We evaluated pilocarpine hydrochloride for the treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia, a common complication of irradiation of the head and neck. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken to test the safety and efficacy of pilocarpine, particularly in reversing the decrease in the production of saliva and other manifestations of xerostomia. Patients received either placebo or pilocarpine (5 mg or 10 mg orally three times a day) for 12 weeks and were evaluated at base line and every 4 weeks.\n                We studied 207 patients who had each received > or = 4000 cGy of radiation to the head and neck. In the patients receiving the 5-mg dose of pilocarpine, oral dryness improved in 44 percent, as compared with 25 percent of the patients receiving placebo (P = 0.027). There was overall improvement in 54 percent of the 5-mg group as compared with 25 percent of the placebo group (P = 0.003), and 31 percent of the 5-mg group had improved comfort of the mouth and tongue, as compared with 10 percent of the placebo group (P = 0.002). Speaking ability improved in 33 percent of the 5-mg group as compared with 18 percent of the placebo group (P = 0.037). Saliva production was improved, but it did not correlate with symptomatic relief. There were comparable improvements in the group receiving the 10-mg dose. The primary adverse effect was sweating, in addition to other minor cholinergic effects. Six and 29 percent of the patients in the 5-mg and 10-mg groups, respectively, withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. There were no serious adverse effects related to pilocarpine.\n                Pilocarpine improved saliva production and relieved symptoms of xerostomia after irradiation for cancer of the head and neck, with minor side effects that were predominantly limited to sweating.",

        "document": "Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained cardiac arrhythmia. Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm is believed by many physicians to be superior to rate control only. However, there are no prospective data that compare both therapeutic strategies.\n                The Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF) trial was a randomised trial in 252 patients with atrial fibrillation of between 7 days and 360 days duration, which compared rate (group A, 125 patients) with rhythm control (group B, 127 patients). In group A, diltiazem was used as first-line therapy and amiodarone was used in group B. The primary study endpoint was improvement in symptoms related to atrial fibrillation.\n                Over the entire observation period of 1 year, a similar proportion of patients reported improvement in symptoms in both groups (76 responders at 12 months in group A vs 70 responders in group B, p=0.317). Amiodarone administration resulted in pharmacological restoration of sinus rhythm in 23% of patients. Walking distance in a 6 min walk test was better in group B compared with group A, but assessment of quality of life showed no differences between groups. The incidence of hospital admission was higher in group B (87 [69%] out of 127 vs 30 [24%] out of 125 in group A, p=0.001). Adverse drug effects more frequently led to a change in therapy in group B (31 [25%] patients compared with 17 [14%] in group A, p=0.036).\n                With respect to symptomatic improvement in patients with atrial fibrillation, the therapeutic strategies of rate versus rhythm control yielded similar clinical results overall. However, exercise tolerance is better with rhythm control, although hospital admission is more frequent. These data may serve as a basis to select therapy in individual patients. There are two approaches to the treatment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recommended.\n                We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality.\n                A total of 4060 patients (mean [+/-SD] age, 69.7+/-9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 percent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic.\n                Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage over the rate-control strategy, and there are potential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy. Anticoagulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients.\n                Copyright 2002 Massachusetts Medical Society",

We found a 24% reduction in the total dyskinesia score after amantadine administration (p = 0.004). This improvement was achieved without any influence on the severity of \"on\" period parkinsonism. The results confirm that amantadine reduces levodopa dyskinesias and support the hypothesis that dyskinesias can be reduced by blockade of excitatory pathways in the basal ganglia. L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias constitute a challenge to the management of advanced Parkinson's disease. According to recent reports, treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist amantadine may significantly diminish L-dopa-induced dyskinesias. In the present study, the effect of amantadine on L-dopa-induced dykinesias was assessed in a 5-week, double-blind crossover trial. Dyskinesia severity as assessed following oral L-dopa challenges and by self-scoring dyskinesia diaries were reduced approximately 50% after amantadine treatment compared with baseline or placebo phases. Similarly, dyskinesia assessments on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part IV (items 32 and 33) also revealed significant improvement after treatment with amantadine. The magnitude of the L-dopa motor response to oral challenges was not different after amantadine or placebo treatment, and there was no significant reduction of daily off-time when patients received active treatment. These results confirm previous observations concerning the antidyskinetic potential of amantadine.

Amantadine, a well-tolerated and modestly effective antiparkinsonian agent, was recently found to possess NMDA antagonistic properties.\n                Eighteen patients with advanced PD participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. At the end of each 3-week treatment arm, parkinsonian and dyskinesia scores were obtained during a steady-state intravenous levodopa infusion. Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias were also documented with patient-kept diaries and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) interviews.\n                In the 14 patients completing this trial, amantadine reduced dyskinesia severity by 60% (p = 0.001) compared to placebo, without altering the antiparkinsonian effect of levodopa. Motor fluctuations occurring with patients' regular oral levodopa regimen also improved according to UPDRS and patient-kept diaries.\n                These findings suggest that amantadine given as adjuvant to levodopa can markedly improve motor response complications and support the view that hyperfunction of NMDA receptors contributes to the pathogenesis of levodopa-associated motor complications.",

Twenty stable, nondemented patients with PD entered a 6-week rehabilitation program and were randomly assigned to two balanced protocols which were differentiated by the use of external sensory cues (\"non-cued\" vs \"cued\"). Patients were evaluated by a neurologist, who was blind to group membership, with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) at baseline, end of treatment, and after 6 weeks. Patient groups were comparable for age, disease duration, and severity. A significant reduction of UPDRS scores (activities of daily living and motor sections) was present after the rehabilitation phase in both groups. However, at follow up, while this clinical improvement had largely faded in the \"non-cued\" group, mean UPDRS scores of the \"cued\" group were still significantly lower than baseline values. The incorporation of external sensory cues in the rehabilitation protocol can extend the short-term benefit of physical therapy in moderately disabled patients with PD, possibly as a result of the learning of new motor strategies. \"Cued\" physical therapy for PD should be targeted to compensate for the defective physiological mechanisms. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) was used as a pacemaker during a 3-week home-based gait-training program for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (n = 15). Electromyogram (EMG) patterns and stride parameters were assessed before and after the test without RAS to evaluate changes in gait patterns. Data were compared with those of two control groups (n = 11), who either did not participate in any gait training or who participated in an internally self-paced training program. RAS consisted of audiotapes with metronome-pulse patterns embedded into the on/off beat structure of rhythmically accentuated instrumental music. Patients who trained with RAS significantly (p < 0.05) improved their gait velocity by 25%, stride length by 12%, and step cadence by 10% more than self-paced subjects who improved their velocity by 7% and no-training subjects whose velocity decreased by 7%. In the RAS-group, timing of EMG patterns changed significantly (p < 0.05) in the anterior tibialis and vastus lateralis muscles. Evidence for rhythmic entrainment of gait patterns was shown by the ability of the RAS group to reproduce the speed of the last training tape within a 2% margin of error without RAS.",

Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients, carers, physiotherapists and physicians should be chosen and the patients monitored for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any effect.

There were statistically significant reductions in the recurrence (dipyrone = 25%, placebo = 50%) and use of rescue medication (dipyrone = 20%, placebo = 47.6%) for the dipyrone group. Intravenous dipyrone is an effective drug for the relief of pain in tension-type headache and its use is justified in the emergency room setting. We assessed the efficacy and safety of oral single doses of 0.5 and 1 g metamizol vs. 1 g acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in 417 patients with moderate episodic tension-type headache included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel, multicentre trial. Eligibility criteria included 18-65 years of age, history of at least two episodes of tension-type headache per month in the 3 months prior to enrollment, and successful previous pain relief with a non-opioid analgesic. Treatment arms were metamizol 0.5 g (n = 102), metamizol 1 g (n = 108), ASA 1 g (n = 102) and placebo (n = 105). The analgesic efficacy of 0.5 and 1 g metamizol vs. placebo was highly statistically significant (alpha: 0.025; one-sided) for sum of pain intensity differences, maximum pain intensity difference, number of patients with at least 50% pain reduction, time to 50% pain reduction, maximum pain relief and total pain relief. A trend towards an earlier onset of a more profound pain relief of 0.5 and 1 g metamizol over 1 g ASA was noticed. All medications including placebo were almost equally safe and well tolerated. In spite of the enormous amount of research regarding classification, epidemiology, diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of migraines, aura, one of its hallmarks, stays much less studied. The objective of this study is, therefore, to evaluate the evolution of aura in patients submitted to placebo and three different drugs available in Brazilian public health units. We studied 86 patients during an acute migrainous attack, with aura at the moment of the evaluation. Patients were randomized to receive one of the following substances, in a parenteral route: placebo, dipyrone, chlorpromazine and magnesium sulphate. Magnesium sulphate was superior to placebo (p <0,05) 30 and 60 minutes after its administration. Dipyrone and chlorpromazine reduced the duration of the aura, when compared to placebo, 60 minutes following their administration. Our findings make possible some speculations about the pathophysiology of migraine, as well as about the therapeutic approach of patients presenting migrainous aura. Dipyrone (Metamizol) has been used in the acute treatment of migraines in Brazil. Some investigators have found it to be a highly effective medication for migraine pain and associated symptoms.\n                To conduct a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study to assess the effect of dipyrone on the pain and symptoms associated with migraine without aura or with aura and the adverse effect profile of this medication.\n                For the migraine without aura group, 44 patients were assigned at random to receive 1 g intravenous dipyrone, and 30 patients received 10 mL 0.9% physiological saline. For the migraine with aura group, 30 patients received both dipyrone or placebo. We used seven parameters of analgesic evaluation and an analog scale to assess nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia.\n                Patients receiving dipyrone demonstrated a statistically superior improvement (P<.05 and P<.01) in pain and all associated symptoms compared with control subjects.\n                Dipyrone is an effective drug for the relief of acute migraine pain and associated symptoms.",

However, 6 weeks of DHEA administration (but not placebo) was associated with a significant improvement in Positive and Negative Symptom Scale ratings compared with baseline. Furthermore, 6 weeks of DHEA treatment was associated with significant improvement in cognitive functions of visual sustained attention and visual and movement skills compared with placebo conditions. The DHEA augmentation was associated with elevations of serum concentrations of both DHEA and its sulfate ester.

The role of corticosteroids in the treatment of herpes zoster is also controversial.\n                We conducted a double-blind, controlled trial in patients with acute herpes zoster to determine whether either 21 days of acyclovir therapy or the addition of prednisolone offered any improvement over 7 days of acyclovir therapy. Patients with a rash of less than 72 hours' duration were assigned to receive acyclovir (800 mg orally, five times daily) for 7 days with either prednisolone or placebo, or acyclovir for 21 days with either prednisolone or placebo. Prednisolone therapy was initiated at a dose of 40 mg per day and tapered over a three-week period. Patients were assessed frequently through day 28 and then monthly through month 6 to assess postherpetic neuralgia.\n                Of 400 patients recruited, 349 completed the study. No significant differences were detected between the four groups in the progression of the rash (P > 0.1). With steroid therapy, a significantly higher proportion of the rash area had healed on days 7 and 14 (P = 0.02). Pain reduction was greater during the acute phase of disease in patients treated with steroids or 21 days of acyclovir (P < 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively, on day 7; P < 0.01 for steroid therapy on day 14). However, on follow-up there were no significant differences between any of the groups in the time to a first or a complete cessation of pain. The steroid recipients reported more adverse events.\n                In acute herpes zoster, treatment with acyclovir for 21 days or the addition of prednisolone to acyclovir therapy confers only slight benefits over standard 7-day treatment with acyclovir. Neither additional treatment reduces the frequency of postherpetic neuralgia. In a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of the effect of prednisolone on the development of post-herpetic neuralgia 78 patients with herpes zoster whose pain and exanthema had been present for less than 96 h were given 800 mg acyclovir five times daily for 7 days and prednisolone in a total dose of 575 mg, starting with 40 mg daily in the first week and tapering off over the next 2 weeks. 18 (23%) of the patients had post-herpetic neuralgia at 6 months after the acute zoster, 9 (24.3%) having received prednisolone and 9 (22.5%) placebo. The 95% CI for the difference between the placebo and prednisolone groups in the proportion of patients having pain at 6 months was minus 17% to plus 20%. Prednisolone, however, relieved pain for the first 3 days. The 1-2 week interval between admission and reappearance of pain and development of triggered pain seems to be the time needed to establish neuralgia. Once established, the type and intensity of pain remained largely unaltered. To determine the effect of acyclovir and prednisone treatment of herpes zoster on chronic pain and quality-of-life outcomes.\n                Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 2 x 2 factorial design.\n                15 university hospitals or affilliated clinics.\n                208 immunocompetent patients older than 50 years of age who had localized herpes zoster that developed less than 72 hours before study enrollment.\n                Acyclovir or a matched placebo was administered orally, 800 mg five times daily, for 21 days. Prednisone or a matched placebo was administered orally at 60 mg/d for the first 7 days, 30 mg/d for days 8 to 14, and 15 mg/d for days 15 to 21. The four treatments regimens given were acyclovir plus prednisone; acyclovir plus prednisone placebo; prednisone plus acyclovir placebo; and placebos for both acyclovir and prednisone.\n                Patients were monitored daily for the first 28 days for lesion healing, resolution of pain, return to usual activity, and return to uninterrupted sleep. Monitoring was then done monthly for 6 months. Patients documented analgesic requirements each day, and adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were recorded at each clinical visit. An intention-to-treat analysis was used.\n                Patients were randomly allocated to receive one of the four regimens. Demographic characteristics were similar for each group. Time to total crusting and healing was accelerated for patients receiving acyclovir plus prednisone compared with patients receiving two placebos; the risk ratios were 2.27 (95% Cl, 1.46 to 3.55) for total crusting and 2.07 (Cl, 1.26 to 3.38) for healing. Similarly, compared with the placebo group, patients receiving acyclovir plus prednisone had accelerated time to cessation of acute neuritis (risk ratio, 3.02 [Cl, 1.42 to 6.41]), time to return to uninterrupted sleep (risk ratio, 2.12 [Cl, 1.25 to 3.58]); time to return to usual daily activity (risk ratio, 3.22 [Cl, 1.92 to 5.40]); and time to cessation of analgesic therapy (risk ratio, 3.15 [Cl, 1.69 to 5.89]). In the acyclovir plus prednisone group, resolution of pain during the 6 months after disease onset did not statistically differ from that in the other groups. No important clinical or laboratory adverse events occurred in any group.\n                In relatively healthy persons older than 50 years of age who have localized herpes zoster, combined acyclovir and prednisone therapy can improve quality of life.",

Concurrent antiepileptic drugs were unaltered. After a 3-month baseline, patients were surgically implanted with stimulating leads coiled around the left vagus nerve and connected to an infraclavicular subcutaneous programmable pacemaker-like generator. After randomization, device initiation, and a 2-week ramp-up period, patients were assessed for seizure counts and safety over 3 months. The primary efficacy variable was the percentage change in total seizure frequency compared with baseline.\n                Patients receiving high stimulation (94 patients, ages 13 to 54 years) had an average 28% reduction in total seizure frequency compared with a 15% reduction in the low stimulation group (102 patients, ages 15 to 60 year; p = 0.04).

        "document": "Thrombolytic treatment has been tried in various forms for acute limb ischaemia with varying degrees of success but is also often accompanied by bleeding problems. The present investigation compares the effect of surgical thrombectomy (TE) and thrombolysis (TL) using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Twenty patients with a need for intervention owing to ischaemia lasting more than 24 h but less than 14 days were included. Patients randomised to TE were operated under epidural anaesthesia and patients in the TL group received 30 mg rt-PA during a 3 h period through a catheter placed into the thrombus and advanced as lysis was achieved. Thrombectomy resulted in an immediate restitution of blood flow in six out of nine cases, in three cases a bypass procedure was performed, and one of these failed with a resultant amputation. Thrombolysis gave a good primary result in six cases which lasted in four of them. Three had a subsequent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Partial lysis was seen in two cases and a further two failed. Five went to surgery with three bypass and two fogarty procedures being necessary. There was no hospital mortality and there were no bleeding complications due to the rt-PA treatment in this series. In 19 out of 20 patients the circulation was re-established. Appropriate handling of acute ischaemic conditions implies the use of both thrombolysis and appropriate surgical procedures, including distal bypass grafts. Despite the widespread use of intraarterial thrombolytic therapy for peripheral arterial occlusive disease, a randomized study comparing its efficacy with that of operative intervention has never been performed. This study evaluates the potential of intraarterial urokinase infusion to provide clinical benefits in patients with acute peripheral arterial occlusion.\n                Patients with limb-threatening ischemia of less than 7 days' duration were randomly assigned to intraarterial catheter-directed urokinase therapy or operative intervention. Anatomic lesions unmasked by thrombolysis were treated with balloon dilation or operation. The primary end points of the study were limb salvage and survival.\n                A total of 57 patients were randomized to the thrombolytic therapy group, and 57 patients were randomized to the operative therapy group. Thrombolytic therapy resulted in dissolution of the occluding thrombus in 40 (70%) patients. Although the cumulative limb salvage rate was similar in the two treatment groups (82% at 12 months), the cumulative survival rate was significantly improved in patients randomized to the thrombolysis group (84% vs 58% at 12 months, p = 0.01). The mortality differences seemed to be primarily attributable to an increased frequency of in-hospital cardiopulmonary complications in the operative treatment group (49% vs 16%, p = 0.001). The benefits of thrombolysis were achieved without significant differences in the duration of hospitalization (median 11 days) and with only modest increases in hospital cost in the thrombolytic treatment arm (median $15,672 vs $12,253, p = 0.02).\n                Intraarterial thrombolytic therapy was associated with a reduction in the incidence of in-hospital cardiopulmonary complications and a corresponding increase in patient survival rates. These benefits were achieved without an appreciable increase in the duration of hospitalization and with only modest increases in hospital cost, suggesting that thrombolytic therapy may offer a safe and effective alternative to operation in the initial treatment of patients diagnosed with acute limb-threatening peripheral arterial occlusion. Recent controlled trials suggest that thrombolytic therapy may be an effective initial treatment for acute arterial occlusion of the legs. A major potential benefit of initial thrombolytic therapy is that limb ischemia can be managed with less invasive interventions.\n                In this randomized, multicenter trial conducted at 113 North American and European sites, we compared vascular surgery (e.g., thrombectomy or bypass surgery) with thrombolysis by catheter-directed intraarterial recombinant urokinase; all patients (272 per group) had had acute arterial obstruction of the legs for 14 days or less. Infusions were limited to a period of 48 hours (mean [+/-SE], 24.4+/-0.86), after which lesions were corrected by surgery or angioplasty if needed. The primary end point was the amputation-free survival rate at six months.\n                Final angiograms, which were available for 246 patients treated with urokinase, revealed recanalization in 196 (79.7 percent) and complete dissolution of thrombus in 167 (67.9 percent). Both treatment groups had similar significant improvements in mean ankle-brachial blood-pressure index. Amputation-free survival rates in the urokinase group were 71.8 percent at six months and 65.0 percent at one year, as compared with respective rates of 74.8 percent and 69.9 percent in the surgery group; the 95 percent confidence intervals for the differences were -10.5 to 4.5 percentage points at six months (P=0.43) and -12.9 to 3.1 percentage points at one year (P=0.23). At six months the surgery group had undergone 551 open operative procedures (excluding amputations), as compared with 315 in the thrombolysis group. Major hemorrhage occurred in 32 patients in the urokinase group (12.5 percent) as compared with 14 patients in the surgery group (5.5 percent) (P= 0.005). There were four episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the urokinase group (1.6 percent), one of which was fatal. By contrast, there were no episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the surgery group.\n                Despite its association with a higher frequency of hemorrhagic complications, intraarterial infusion of urokinase reduced the need for open surgical procedures, with no significantly increased risk of amputation or death.",
        "target_summary": "Universal initial treatment with either surgery or thrombolysis cannot be advocated on the available evidence. There is no overall difference in limb salvage or death at one year between initial surgery and initial thrombolysis. Thrombolysis may be associated with a higher risk of ongoing limb ischaemia and haemorrhagic complications including stroke. The higher risk of complications must be balanced against risks of surgery in each person.",

The experimental group followed a 12-week programme of aquatic physical exercises. The two groups were evaluated in a pre- and post-treatment and then results from both groups were compared. Data were collected by administering a generic health-related quality of life survey (SF-36).\n                Significant differences were found between the pre- and post-treatment in the experimental group. In the between-groups evaluation, significant differences were recorded with regard to functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, general state of health, vitality, social aspects and mental health.\n                Doing physical exercises in water tends to improve motor behaviour, with a greater degree of independence, significant improvements in functional capacity and other aspects linked to physical aptitude. As a result, the level of quality of life of individuals affected by ischaemic CVA is enhanced.

The conventional therapy group performed gym exercises. In both groups, the interventions occurred for 1 hour, three times per week, for eight weeks.\n                The primary outcome measures were Berg Balance Scale score and weight-bearing ability, as measured by vertical ground reaction force during four standing tasks (rising from a chair and weight-shifting forward, backward and laterally). Secondary measures were muscle strength and gait.\n                Compared with the conventional therapy group, the aquatic therapy group attained significant improvements in Berg Balance Scale scores, forward and backward weight-bearing abilities of the affected limbs, and knee flexor strength (P < 0.05), with effect sizes of 1.03, 1.14, 0.72 and 1.13 standard deviation units and powers of 75, 81, 70 and 26%, respectively. There were no significant changes in the other measures between the two groups.\n                Postural balance and knee flexor strength were improved after aquatic therapy based on the Halliwick and Ai Chi methods in stroke survivors.

The study's primary endpoint was change in CDAI at week 2.\n                At week 2, the CDAI decreased significantly from baseline after infusion of natalizumab (mean 45 points) but not placebo (mean 11 points). Seven (39%) natalizumab-treated patients achieved remission at week 2, compared with 1 (8%) treated with placebo. In contrast, 4 (33%) of the placebo-treated patients required rescue medication by week 2, compared with 2 (11%) natalizumab-treated patients. Significant increases in circulating B and T lymphocytes were detected only after natalizumab administration. The frequency of commonly reported adverse events did not differ significantly between groups.\n                A single 3-mg/kg natalizumab infusion was well tolerated by Crohn's disease patients, although the dose used may have been suboptimal. Elevated circulating lymphocyte levels after natalizumab suggest interrupted lymphocyte trafficking. Natalizumab therapy in active Crohn's disease merits further investigation. In chronic inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease, the migration of leukocytes from the circulation into the parenchyma and their activation within inflammatory sites are mediated in part by alpha4 integrins.\n                We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the alpha4 integrin-specific humanized monoclonal antibody natalizumab in 248 patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments: two infusions of placebo; one infusion of 3 mg of natalizumab per kilogram of body weight, followed by placebo; two infusions of 3 mg of natalizumab per kilogram; or two infusions of 6 mg of natalizumab per kilogram. Infusions were given four weeks apart. Outcomes included changes in scores for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (higher scores indicate more severe disease), the health-related quality of life, and C-reactive protein levels.\n                The group given two infusions of 6 mg of natalizumab per kilogram did not have a significantly higher rate of clinical remission (defined by a score of less than 150 on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index) than the placebo group at week 6 (the prospectively defined primary end point in the efficacy analysis). However, both groups that received two infusions of natalizumab had higher remission rates than the placebo group at multiple time points. Natalizumab also produced a significant improvement in response rates (defined by a reduction of at least 70 points in the score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index). The highest remission rate was 44 percent and the highest response rate was 71 percent (at week 6 in the group given two infusions of 3 mg per kilogram). Overall, the two infusions of 6 mg of natalizumab per kilogram and of 3 mg per kilogram had similar effects. The quality of life improved in all natalizumab groups; C-reactive protein levels improved in groups receiving two infusions of natalizumab. The rates of adverse events were similar in all four groups.\n                Treatment with the selective adhesion-molecule inhibitor natalizumab increased the rates of clinical remission and response, improved the quality of life and C-reactive protein levels, and was well tolerated in patients with active Crohn's disease.\n                Copyright 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society Natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against alpha4 integrin, inhibits leukocyte adhesion and migration into inflamed tissue.\n                We conducted two controlled trials to evaluate natalizumab as induction and maintenance therapy in patients with active Crohn's disease. In the first trial, 905 patients were randomly assigned to receive 300 mg of natalizumab or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The primary outcome was response, defined by a decrease in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of at least 70 points, at week 10. In the second trial, 339 patients who had a response to natalizumab in the first trial were randomly reassigned to receive 300 mg of natalizumab or placebo every four weeks through week 56. The primary outcome was a sustained response through week 36. A secondary outcome in both trials was disease remission (a CDAI score of less than 150).\n                In the first trial, the natalizumab and placebo groups had similar rates of response (56 percent and 49 percent, respectively; P=0.05) and remission (37 percent and 30 percent, respectively; P=0.12) at 10 weeks. Continuing natalizumab in the second trial resulted in higher rates of sustained response (61 percent vs. 28 percent, P<0.001) and remission (44 percent vs. 26 percent, P=0.003) through week 36 than did switching to placebo. Serious adverse events occurred in 7 percent of each group in the first trial and in 10 percent of the placebo group and 8 percent of the natalizumab group in the second trial. In an open-label extension study, a patient treated with natalizumab died from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, associated with the JC virus, a human polyomavirus.\n                Induction therapy with natalizumab for Crohn's disease resulted in small, nonsignificant improvements in response and remission rates. Patients who had a response had significantly increased rates of sustained response and remission if natalizumab was continued every four weeks. The benefit of natalizumab will need to be weighed against the risk of serious adverse events, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

The agents were injected into the cysts through stereotactically inserted silicone tubes. Follow-up was done for a minimum of 6 months. Outcome was based on a comparison of the volume of cysts before treatment and at follow-up.

Four tumors in group A were polycystic, and the drug was selectively injected into the largest cyst. At follow-up, the volumes of the cysts in groups A and B regressed from 92 to 0%, while the drug-free cysts enlarged. In group B, 6 cysts almost disappeared and another 3 regressed from 78 to 57%. In group C, one cyst progressed and the others shrank by different degrees, but none disappeared completely or nearly. All patients in groups A and B had fever of different degrees, which resolved spontaneously in 8-24 h. The complications in group B included hyponatremia in 1 patient, and both adephagia obesity and cerebral infarction in 2 patients (1 of whom died after 6 months).

        "document": "The fixation of tibial components randomized to insertion with or without cement in twenty-six knees was examined for inducible displacement at six weeks and one year postoperatively with use of roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis. Furthermore, migration was studied during the first two postoperative years. Inducible displacement was found in all knees at both the six-week and the one-year follow-up examination, but no differences were detected with respect to the type of fixation (p > 0.05). All tibial components migrated for as long as one year postoperatively, after which most stabilized. No difference was found between the groups with respect to migration during the first two years postoperatively (p > 0.05), with the exception of subsidence of the component, which was found to be 0.0+/-0.1 millimeter (mean and standard error of the mean) for the components inserted with cement and 0.5+/-0.1 millimeter for the components inserted without cement (p < 0.01). Migration after one year was the same for both groups. We found a relationship between inducible displacement at six weeks and at one year as well as one between inducible displacement and migration at one year. To our knowledge, the present study is the first in which the micromotion of an interference-fit prosthesis was found to be similar to that of a device inserted with cement. The results of the present study emphasize the importance of the initial prosthetic fixation. We have carried out a radiostereometric study of 50 patients (54 knees) with osteoarthritis of the knee who were randomly allocated to receive a cemented or a hydroxyapatite-coated femoral component for total knee replacement. The patients were also stratified to receive one of three types of articulating surface (standard, rotating platform, Freeman-Samuelson (FS)1000) all based on the Freeman-Samuelson design. The tibial components were cemented in all cases. Radiostereometry was performed post-operatively and at 3, 12 and 24 months. The analysis was restricted to rotation of the femoral component over time. After two years, rotation of the femoral components in the transverse, longitudinal and sagittal planes did not differ between the cemented and the hydroxyapatite-coated implants (p = 0.2 to 0.9). In total knee replacements with a rotating platform, the femoral component tended to tilt more posteriorly than in the other two designs, regardless of the choice of fixation (cemented or hydroxyapatite-coated, p = 0.04). The standard version of the femoral component, whether cemented or hydroxyapatite-coated, rotated more into valgus than was observed with the rotating-platform and FS1000 designs (p = 0.005). The increased constraint provided by the FS1000 component did not appear to have any adverse effect on fixation of the femoral component. The use of cement is considered as an important way to control perioperative blood loss in knee arthroplasty. We prospectively randomized 57 patients (60 knees) who underwent total knee arthroplasty with (30 knees) or without (30 knees) tibial cement to evaluate perioperative blood loss. The measured total blood loss did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (with tibial cement, 731 +/- 288 mL; without cement, 731 +/- 331 mL; P = .9117). The red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit returned to the preoperative levels within 3 months in both groups. Therefore, tibial cement does not appear to affect perioperative blood loss. This finding has implications when planning blood replacement in cementless and hybrid-type arthroplasties. The question whether the tibial component of a total knee arthroplasty should be fixed to bone with or without bone cement has not yet been definitely answered. We studied movements between the tibial component and bone by radiostereometry (RSA) in total knee replacement (TKR) for 3 different types of fixation: cemented fixation (C-F), uncemented porous fixation (UC-F) and uncemented porous hydroxyapatite fixation (UCHA-F).\n                116 patients with osteoarthrosis, who had 146 TKRs, were included in 2 randomized series. The first series included 86 unilateral TKRs stratified into 1 of the 3 types of fixation. The second series included 30 patients who had simultaneous bilateral TKR surgery, and who were stratified into 3 subgroups of pairwise comparisons of the 3 types of fixation.\n                After 5 years 2 knees had been revised, neither of which were due to loosening. 1 UCHA-F knee in the unilateral series showed a large and continuous migration and a poor clinical result, and is a pending failure. The C-F knees rotated and migrated less than UC-F and UCHA-F knees over 5 years. UCHA-F migrated less than UC-F after 1 year.\n                Cementing of the tibial component offers more stable bone-implant contact for 5 years compared to uncemented fixation. When using uncemented components, however, there is evidence that augmenting a porous surface with hydroxyapatite may mean less motion between implant and bone after the initial postoperative year. Fifty-three consecutive patients (57 knees; mean age, 69 years) entered a prospective randomized study to compare the fixation of hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated (29 knees) with cemented (28 knees) tibial components in the Tricon II total knee arthroplasty. The quality of the fixation during 5 years postoperatively was evaluated with radiostereometric analysis (RSA). Three HA-coated implants were revised: 2 owing to infection, and 1 owing to early delamination of the coating and clinical loosening. Eight patients (9 knees) died, 1 patient sustained a stroke, and 1 patient refused investigations after 1 year. In the 40 patients (19 HA-coated, 21 cemented) remaining at 5 years, the magnitude of the micromotion between the HA-coated and cemented groups did not differ. The HA-coated implants displayed most of the migration within the initial 3 months then stabilized, whereas the cemented implants showed an initially lower, but over time continuously increasing migration. Between 1 and 2 years, 4 of 24 HA-coated and 10 of 23 cemented implants migrated >0.2 mm and were categorized unstable, which has been shown to have a prognostic value as regards future aseptic loosening. Progressive radiolucent lines developed in 2 cemented knees, which both were categorized unstable. If HA-coated implants can sustain the forces that threaten the fixation in the early period after implantation, a strong and enduring fixation may be obtained.",
        "target_summary": "There was a smaller displacement of the cemented tibial component in relation to the cementless fixation in studies with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis participants who underwent primary total knee prosthesis with a follow-up of two years; however, the cemented fixation presented a greater risk of future aseptic loosening than cementless fixation.",

        "document": "We randomly assigned 71 patients with active chronic Crohn's disease who were resistant to or intolerant of corticosteroids to treatment with oral cyclosporine (5 to 7.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) or placebo for three months. Disease activity was assessed on a clinical grading scale without knowledge of the treatment given. At the end of the treatment period, 22 of the 37 cyclosporine-treated patients (59 percent) had improvement, as compared with 11 of the 34 placebo-treated patients (32 percent) (P = 0.032). During cyclosporine treatment, there was significant improvement in plasma orosomucoid levels (P = 0.0025) and the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (P = 0.00012). The effect of treatment became evident after two weeks. In the subsequent three months, during which the patients were gradually withdrawn from treatment, the improvement continued in 14 of the 37 patients (38 percent) in the cyclosporine group and in 5 of the 34 (15 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.034). No serious adverse events were observed. We conclude that cyclosporine has a beneficial therapeutic effect in patients with active chronic Crohn's disease and resistance to or intolerance of corticosteroids. The role of cyclosporine in Crohn's disease is controversial. This study aimed to delineate the long-term effect of cyclosporine in chronic active Crohn's disease.\n                One hundred eighty-two patients from 33 European centers were included. The patient cohort was stratified at entry into a stratum with low Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ( < 200) and high CDAI ( > 200). The low-activity group continued to receive the pretrial steroid dose for 2 months, and the high-activity group received 1 mg.kg-1.day-1 prednisone initially. During months 3 and 4, the dose of steroids was reduced stepwise to 5 mg/day in all patients. Placebo and cyclosporine (5 mg.kg-1.day-1) were administered throughout the 12-month study period. The main parameter of efficacy was the CDAI, and the main end point was the number of patients in remission at month 12.\n                During cyclosporine therapy, 35% (95% confidence interval [95% Cl], 25%-46%) of the patients achieved a full remission (CDAI, < 150) after 4 months compared with 27% (95% Cl, 18%-38%) in the placebo group (P > 0.05). At month 12, only 20% (95% Cl, 12%-31%) vs. 20% (95% Cl, 12%-31%) of the patients had maintained a continuous remission. No major differences between treatment groups were found within each of the two strata.\n                The long-term treatment of chronic active Crohn's disease with cyclosporine plus low-dose steroids does not offer an advantage compared with low-dose steroids alone. Long-term corticosteroid therapy for Crohn's disease is associated with important types of morbidity, such as osteoporosis. Safe and effective alternative treatments are required. Although a short-term benefit of cyclosporine in active Crohn's disease has been suggested, the long-term safety and efficacy of this treatment have not been established.\n                We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the effect of 18 months of low-dose cyclosporine treatment on the course of Crohn's disease. Adult patients whose disease had been active within the previous two years were randomly assigned to receive cyclosporine (151 patients) or placebo (154 patients) in addition to their usual therapy. Randomization was stratified according to center and score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (193 patients had scores of 150 or less, and 112 had scores greater than 150). The primary outcome measure was clinically important worsening of Crohn's disease, defined as a 100-point increase in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index from the patient's base-line value. Secondary outcomes were the use of prednisone and 5-amino-salicylates, mean score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and mean quality-of-life score, and the need for surgery.\n                The condition of more patients worsened with cyclosporine than with placebo (91 of 151, or 60.3 percent, vs. 80 of 154, or 51.9 percent; P = 0.10). The median time to worsening of disease in patients receiving cyclosporine was 338 days, as compared with 492 days in patients receiving placebo (P = 0.25; relative risk, 1.22; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.72). Analyses of the mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index and quality-of-life scores and of the use of prednisone and 5-aminosalicylates also failed to demonstrate benefit.\n                In our patient population, the addition of low-dose cyclosporine to conventional treatment for Crohn's disease did not improve symptoms or reduce requirements for other forms of therapy.",
        "target_summary": "Brynskov 1989a enrolled a small number of patients and the modified clinical grading scale used in the study has not been validated in other studies. Furthermore, statistically significant clinical improvement does not imply induction of clinical remission. Indeed, Brynskov 1989a found no statistically significant differences in the mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index score at 12 weeks indicating that cyclosporine was no more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. The results of this review demonstrate that low dose (5 mg/kg/day) oral cyclosporine is not effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Patients treated with low dose oral cyclosporine are more likely than placebo treated patients to experience adverse events including renal dysfunction. The use of low dose oral cyclosporine for the treatment of chronic active Crohn's disease does not appear to be justified. Oral dosing at higher levels or parenteral administration of cyclosporine have not been adequately evaluated in controlled clinical trials. Higher doses of cyclosporine are not likely to be useful for the long-term management of Crohn's disease because of the risk of nephrotoxicity and the availability of other proven interventions.",

There was no clinically discernable benefit on the course of their illness. We proposed a new chest physiotherapy (CPT) secretion clearance method to treat respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in infants. Our new CPT method consists of 15 prolonged slow expirations, then 5 provoked cough maneuvers.\n                We randomized 20 infants (mean age 4.2 months) into 2 groups: 8 patients received 27 sessions of nebulization of hypertonic saline; 12 patients received 31 sessions of nebulization of hypertonic saline followed by our new CPT method. We used the Wang clinical severity scoring system (which assesses wheezing, respiratory rate, retractions, and general condition) and measured S(pO(2)) and heart rate before each CPT session (T0), immediately after the 30-min session (T30), and 120 min after the session (T150).\n                Within the groups: in the first group, Wang score was significantly lower at T150 than at T0: 4.6 vs 5.0 (P = .008). In the new-method-CPT group, Wang score was significantly lower at T30 (3.6 vs 4.3, P = .001) and at T150 (3.7 vs 4.3, P = .002). Wheezing score was significantly lower at T150 than at T0 (1.1 vs 1.2, P = .02) in the first group, and in the new-method-CPT group at T30 than at T0 (0.8 vs 1.3, P = .001) and at T150 than at T0 (0.9 vs 1.3, P = .001). Between the groups: at T30 the improvement was significantly better in the new-method-CPT group for overall Wang score (P = .02), retractions (P = .05), respiratory rate (P = .001), and heart rate (P < .001). At T150 the Wang score was not significantly different between the groups. At T30 (versus T0) the difference in percent gain between the groups was significant for Wang score (P = .004), wheezing (P = .001), and heart rate (P = .02). Over 5-hospital days, the daily baseline (T0) Wang score decreased significantly in the new-method-CPT group (P = .002), whereas it did not in the first group. There were no adverse events. Average hospital stay was not significantly different between the groups.\n                Our new CPT method showed short-term benefits to some respiratory symptoms of bronchial obstruction in infants with acute respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. Acute bronchiolitis treatment in children and infants is largely supportive, but chest physiotherapy is routinely performed in some countries. In France, national guidelines recommend a specific type of physiotherapy combining the increased exhalation technique (IET) and assisted cough (AC). Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of chest physiotherapy (IET + AC) in previously healthy infants hospitalized for a first episode of acute bronchiolitis.\n                We conducted a multicenter, randomized, outcome assessor-blind and parent-blind trial in seven French pediatric departments. We recruited 496 infants hospitalized for first-episode acute bronchiolitis between October 2004 and January 2008. Patients were randomly allocated to receive from physiotherapists three times a day, either IET + AC (intervention group, n=246) or nasal suction (NS, control group, n=250). Only physiotherapists were aware of the allocation group of the infant. The primary outcome was time to recovery, defined as 8 hours without oxygen supplementation associated with minimal or no chest recession, and ingesting more than two-thirds of daily food requirements. Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit admissions, artificial ventilation, antibiotic treatment, description of side effects during procedures, and parental perception of comfort. Statistical analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Median time to recovery was 2.31 days, (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97-2.73) for the control group and 2.02 days (95% CI 1.96-2.34) for the intervention group, indicating no significant effect of physiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]=1.09, 95% CI 0.91-1.31, p=0.33). No treatment by age interaction was found (p=0.97). Frequency of vomiting and transient respiratory destabilization was higher in the IET + AC group during the procedure (relative risk [RR]=10.2, 95% CI 1.3-78.8, p=0.005 and RR=5.4, 95% CI 1.6-18.4, p=0.002, respectively). No difference between groups in bradycardia with or without desaturation (RR=1.0, 95% CI 0.2-5.0, p=1.00 and RR=3.6, 95% CI 0.7-16.9, p=0.10, respectively) was found during the procedure. Parents reported that the procedure was more arduous in the group treated with IET (mean difference=0.88, 95% CI 0.33-1.44, p=0.002), whereas there was no difference regarding the assessment of the child's comfort between both groups (mean difference=-0.07, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.38, p=0.40). No evidence of differences between groups in intensive care admission (RR=0.7, 95% CI 0.3-1.8, p=0.62), ventilatory support (RR=2.5, 95% CI 0.5-13.0, p=0.29), and antibiotic treatment (RR=1.0, 95% CI 0.7-1.3, p=1.00) was observed.\n                IET + AC had no significant effect on time to recovery in this group of hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis. Additional studies are required to explore the effect of chest physiotherapy on ambulatory populations and for infants without a history of atopy.\n                ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00125450. To evaluate the benefits of conventional chest physiotherapy in acute bronchiolitis, 32 patients were allocated in a randomized controlled trial, 16 were given twice daily chest physiotherapy compared with 16 controls who were not given chest physiotherapy. The treatment group showed a mean clinical score for respiratory disability at admission of 5.56 (+/- 1.96), and 3.25 (+/- 1.27) when discharged. The control group presented a score of 5.75 (+/- 1.61) and 3.12 (+/- 1.30), p=0.77 and p=0.76 respectively.

One hundred-fifty individuals who called for an intake appointment were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of the following experimental groups: letter prompt received one day before appointment, letter prompt received three days before appointment, orientation letter received one day before appointment or orientation letter received three days before appointment. Individuals assigned to the one day orientation group had significantly lower no-show rates than individuals assigned to the control group (17% vs. 43%). The other groups were not significantly different from the control group. The effectiveness of the one day orientation letter for reducing no-show rates and its application at a CMHC was discussed. The aim was to reduce non-attendance for first-time consultations at psychiatric out-patient clinics.\n                The study was a pragmatic randomized controlled trial; the setting was seven inner-city UK out-patient clinics in Leeds. The participants were 764 subjects of working age with an appointment to attend a psychiatric out-patient clinic for the first time. The intervention was an 'orientation statement' letter delivered 24-48 h before the first appointment compared with standard care. The primary outcome measure was attendance at the first appointment; secondary outcomes included hospitalization, transfer of care, continuing attendance, discharge, presentation at accident and emergency and death by 1 year.\n                Follow-up was for 763 out of 764 subjects (>99%) for primary and for 755 out of 764 subjects (98.8%) of secondary outcome data. The orientation statement significantly reduced the numbers of people failing to attend [79 out of 388 v. 101 out of 376 subjects, relative risk 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-0.98, number needed to treat 16, 95% CI 10-187].\n                Prompting people to go to psychiatric out-patient clinics for the first time encourages them to attend. Pragmatic trials within a busy working environment are possible and informative. The present study attempted to reduce the missed initial appointment rate of an urban CMHC through the use of several intervention strategies. Individuals who called for an intake appointment were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of the following treatment conditions: orientation statement at the time the appointment was made, orientation statement plus phone prompt, or phone prompt only. The orientation statement only group had significantly fewer missed initial appointments than the control group (28% vs. 56%). A client reachability factor also played a role in predicting missed initial appointments.",
        "target_summary": "There is evidence that a simple prompt to attend clinic, very close to the time of the appointment may encourage attendance, and a simple orientation-type letter may be more effective than a telephone prompt. This simple intervention could be a more cost effective means of encouraging compliance at first attendance, but supplementing these data with the results of large, well designed, conducted and reported randomised studies would be desirable.",

        "document": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the separate effect of fluoride dentifrice, fluoride mouthrinsing and fluoride varnish on approximal dental caries. All 252 13-14-yr-old children at an elementary school were selected at random and divided among four groups for a 3-yr longitudinal study. Group 1 received a fluoride dentifrice for home care and a fluoride mouthrinse once a week. Group 2 received a fluoride dentifrice for home care and a placebo mouthrinse once a week. Group 3 received a fluoride dentifrice for home care and a fluoride varnish once every 3 months. Group 4 received a placebo dentifrice for home care and a fluoride rinse once a week. Fluoride rinsing did not give any additional effect compared with placebo-rinsing when a fluoride dentifrice was used for home care. Fluoride varnish gave a significant caries reduction compared with fluoride rinsing. The study's purpose was to evaluate the reduction of dental caries incidence by the association of two preventive methods. 246 students of both sexes aged from 7 to 11 years registered in \"Escola de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o B\u00e1sica da Universidade Federal de Uberl\u00e2ndia\" and living in the urbana area of Uberl\u00e2ndia, state of Minas Gerais, were examined. The sample was distributed into two groups: children from Group 1, which received a semestral topical application of Acidulated Fluor Phosphate at 1.23% and children from Group II, that besides the topical application above related (Group I) also received weekly mouthwashes of sodium fluoride aquesus solution at 0.2%. After two years of study DMFS index were tabled and statistically analysed. It was verified a reduction of 33.97% in the incidence of dental caries (in the permanent dentition). The difference between the Groups was significant at 5% level of confidence. 751 14- and 15-year old children completed a 3-year, double-blind, caries preventive program. The effects of daily, supervised toothbrushing with an 0.76% sodium monofluorophosphate dentifrice, rinsing with a 0.05% sodium fluoride mouthrinse, and the combined effects of the two treatments were investigated. Both the dentifrice and mouthrinse reduced the incidence of dental caries, but their combined use at the same time had no greater effect than either used alone. 376 three-year old children were divided into four experimental groups and exposed to different combinations of preventive programs for a period of two years. All the groups were given the same basic prophylactic information. Additionally Group I received fluoride tablets (FLUDENT) for daily sucking twice a day plus a placebo dentifrice free of fluoride. Group II was given a fluoride dentifrice containing 0.025% F, (ACTA). Group III was given a placebo dentifrice plus fluoride varnish (Duraphat) twice a year. Group IV a fluoride dentifrice containing 0.025% F (ACTA) plus fluoride varnish (Duraphat) twice a year. No statistically significant difference in caries increment during the two experimental years was found between the groups. A tendency to lower caries increment was found in Group IV, i.e. in the children using the low fluoride dentifrice and treated twice a year with fluoride varnish. The study groups using a dentifrice and mouthrinse both containing fluorides, a dentifrice containing stannous fluoride and a mouthrinse containing sodium fluoride, or a mouthrinse containing sodium fluoride with a placebo dentifrice had a 20.7% to 29.0% lower DMF increment than the control group after 30 months. These differences were significant. The study groups using a dentifrice containing amine fluorides and a placebo mouthrinse, a mouthrinse containing amine fluorides and a placebo dentifrice, or a dentifrice containing stannous fluoride and a placebo mouthrinse had a 13.6% to 22.4% lower DMF increment than the control group.

        "document": "We conducted a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial to study the effect of Synacthen Depot in 18 parturients with postdural puncture headache following deliberate or accidental dural puncture. Women were randomly allocated to receive either Synacthen Depot 1 mg (1 ml) or 0.9% saline 1 ml intramuscularly. Using a 10-cm visual analogue scale, severity of headache was measured before and at intervals until 48 h after injection. There was no difference in the severity of headache or requirement for epidural blood patch. We conclude that there is no advantage to the use of Synacthen Depot 1 mg for the treatment of postdural puncture headache. Forty postpartum patients with postdural puncture headache (PDPH) were randomly assigned to receive oral caffeine (300 mg) or a placebo. Intensity of headache, quantitated using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS), was assessed immediately before drug administration and 4 and 24 h later. Relief of PDPH measured as delta VAS (initial VAS - VAS at 4 h) was significantly better in the caffeine than in the placebo group (P = 0.014). Six patients (30%) whose PDPH was relieved by caffeine at 4 h had recurrence of symptoms the following day. Our study demonstrates that caffeine administered orally provides relief, albeit if sometimes transient, from PDPH with minimal side effects. In a study of 11 patients with typical headache following diagnostic lumbar puncture the effect of peroral treatment with theophylline (Euphyllin retard) was compared with that of placebo. When the headache was provoked by orthostatic strain, the six patients in the verum group showed significantly less pain (mean pain score: 16 +/- 3.91) than the five patients in the placebo group (mean pain score: 28 +/- 4.73). This beneficial effect of theophylline on post-puncture headache was subsequently confirmed by open observations of ten additional patients. In view of the small sample size our results should be considered preliminary. Nevertheless, they suggest that additional trials on the benefit of methylxanthines in the treatment of post-puncture headache are called for. To determine the efficacy of sumatriptan in the management of patients presenting for an epidural blood patch for the management of postdural puncture headache.\n                Postdural puncture headache can be quite severe, requiring invasive therapy (ie, epidural blood patch). Sumatriptan has been used successfully in patients with postdural puncture headache, however, its use has not been investigated in a controlled fashion.\n                Ten patients with postdural puncture headache presenting for an epidural blood patch were given either saline or sumatriptan subcutaneously. The severity of the headache was evaluated at baseline and 1 hour following injection. If the headache remained severe, an epidural blood patch was performed.\n                Only one patient in each group received relief from the injection.\n                We do not recommend sumatriptan in patients who have exhausted conservative management of postdural puncture headache. Headache after spinal anesthesia is a common complication is patients undergoing this procedure. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of intravenous hydrocortisone in the treatment of headache after spinal anesthesia in women who have undergone cesarean section.\n                Sixty patients with headache after spinal anesthesia were included. Patients randomly allocated into two groups, 30 patients received only conventional therapy (complete bed rest, hydration, acetaminophen and pethidine). Other 30 patients received conventional therapy plus intravenous hydrocortisone (200 mg first, then 100 mg TID for 48 hours). Mean (+/- SD) of headache intensity at 0, 6, 24, and 48 hours after beginning of treatment was measured using visual analog scale.\n                There was no significant difference in headache intensity between two groups before beginning of treatment. After 6 hours, the mean of headache intensity in 30 patients treated conventionally was 6.63 (+/- 1.35) while it was 2.77 (+/- 1.07) in other patients received intravenous hydrocortisone too (p <0.001). After 24 hours, mean headache intensity was 3.87 (+/- 1.63) in conventionally treated group versus 0.73 (+/- 0.74) in hydrocortisone group (p <0.001). After 48 hours, mean headache intensity was 1.87 (+/- 0.93) in conventionally treated group versus 0.63 (+/- 0.61) in hydrocortisone group (p = 0.001).\n                This study showed the therapeutic effects of intravenous hydrocortisone in reducing headache after spinal anesthesia in women who underwent cesarean section.

However, the efficacy of this practice is not known.\n                Ninety-two patients meeting criteria for a current bipolar I mood episode were randomly assigned to family therapy plus pharmacotherapy, multifamily psychoeducational group therapy plus pharmacotherapy, or pharmacotherapy alone.

Evaluated the effects of a theoretically derived program to prevent mental health problems in children who had experienced the death of a parent. The program was designed to improve variables in the family environment which were specified as mediators of the effects of parental death on child mental health. The evaluation design involved the random assignment of families to either an intervention or control group. The program led to parental ratings of increased warmth in their relationships with their children, increased satisfaction with their social support, and the maintenance of family discussion of grief-related issues. The program also led to parent ratings of decreased conduct disorder and depression problems and overall problems in older children. Significant correlations between the family environment variables and child mental health problems provided further empirical support for the theory underlying the program. Implications for program redesign were derived by reconsidering the adequacy of the program components to change theoretically mediating variables. This study investigates the impact of suicidality on treatment outcome in 107 depressed adolescents who participated in a clinical trial, and received either cognitive-behavioral (CBT), systemic-behavioral-family (SBFT), or non-directive-supportive therapy (NST). Suicidal depressed adolescents had a higher dropout rate and were more likely to be depressed at the end of treatment, in large part due to the particularly poor response of suicidal patients to NST. The relationship between suicidality and treatment response was mediated by severity of depression and hopelessness at intake. Hopelessness should be specifically targeted early in treatment. Suicidal depressed adolescents should not receive NST but a specific treatment like CBT. To design a treatment manual and adherence measure for attachment-based family therapy (ABFT) for adolescent depression and to collect pilot data on the treatment's efficacy.\n                Over a period of 2 years, 32 adolescents meeting criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of ABFT or a 6-week, minimal-contact, waitlist control group. The sample was 78% female and 69% African American; 69% were from low-income, inner-city communities.\n                At post-treatment, 81% of the patients treated with ABFT no longer met criteria for MDD, in contrast with 47% of patients in the waitlist group. Mixed factorial analyses of variance revealed that, compared with the waitlist group, patients treated with ABFT showed a significantly greater reduction in both depressive and anxiety symptoms and family conflict. Of the 15 treated cases assessed at the follow-up, 13 patients (87%) continued to not meet criteria for MDD 6 months after treatment ended.\n                ABFT appears to be a promising treatment and worthy of further development. Although family intervention is practiced in most psychiatric hospitals, there are no adequately controlled studies of its efficacy. This study was designed to answer, in part, the following question: What is the relative efficacy of hospitalization with family intervention as compared with hospitalization without family intervention for patients with major psychiatric disorders who are in need of hospital treatment and for whom both treatments are judged clinically feasible? This is our first report, presenting preliminary data on six-month follow-up for the first three quarters of the total sample of 144 patients (80 with schizophrenic disorder and 64 with major affective disorder).",

        "document": "Teachers are considered the professional group most at risk of developing voice-problems, but limited treatment effectiveness evidence exists. We studied prospectively the effectiveness of a 6-week combined treatment approach using vocal function exercises (VFEs) and vocal hygiene (VH) education with 20 teachers with self-reported voice problems. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to a no-treatment control (n = 11) and a treatment group (n = 9). Fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation was carried out on all subjects before randomization. Two self-report voice outcome measures were used: the Voice-Related Quality of Life (VRQOL) and the Voice Symptom Severity Scale (VoiSS). A Voice Care Knowledge Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), developed specifically for the study, was also used to evaluate change in selected voice knowledge areas. A Student unpaired t test revealed a statistically significant (P < 0.05) improvement in the treatment group as measured by the VoiSS. There was not a significant improvement in the treatment group as measured by the V-RQOL. The difference in voice care knowledge areas was also significant for the treatment group (P < 0.05). This study suggests that a voice treatment approach of VFEs and VH education improved self-reported voice symptoms and voice care knowledge in a group of teachers. Transnasal flexible laryngoscopy (TFL) is an examination of laryngeal anatomy and physiology using continuous light. TFL is being used increasingly by voice pathologists in treatment but with little scientific evidence to support it. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of TFL as a therapeutic tool. The study used a prospective randomized controlled trial. Fifty dysphonic subjects were recruited and randomly assigned to either a traditional treatment group or a TFL-assisted treatment group. The effectiveness of voice therapy in both treatment groups was measured with a package of voice outcome measures. Subjects in both treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements after voice therapy (perceptual auditory rating of voice quality measurement p < 0.01; instrumental electroglottographic measurement p < 0.01; patient questionnaire measurement p < 0.01). The time taken to complete treatment in both groups was recorded. The average (median) time taken to complete voice therapy in the TFL-assisted treatment group was 2 hours less than in the traditional treatment group (p < 0.01). Voice therapy with TFL as a therapy tool was effective and more efficient than traditional voice therapy. Previous studies of students studying to be teachers have indicated that these students commonly have voice disorders. Ideally, voice disorders should be treated before students start their work as teachers, but the resources for this treatment are often limited. This study examines whether group voice therapy is effective for teacher students. Accordingly, 20 teacher students with mild voice disorders received group voice therapy (in three small groups), whereas 20 students with similar voice disorders served as a control group and consequently did not receive voice therapy. Two out of three outcome measures (perceptual evaluation of voice quality and a questionnaire on the occurrence of vocal symptoms) indicated significant changes in the treatment group compared with the control group. No differences between groups were noted in the laryngeal status. The results suggest that group voice therapy seems to be an effective method to treat students with mild voice disorders. To assess the overall efficacy of voice therapy for dysphonia.\n                Single blind randomised controlled trial.\n                Outpatient clinic in a teaching hospital. Participants: 204 outpatients aged 17-87 with a primary symptom of persistent hoarseness for at least two months.\n                After baseline assessments, patients were randomised to six weeks of either voice therapy or no treatment. Assessments were repeated at six weeks on the 145 (71%) patients who continued to this stage and at 12-14 weeks on the 133 (65%) patients who completed the study. The assessments at the three time points for the 70 patients who completed treatment and the 63 patients in the group given no treatment were compared.\n                Ratings of laryngeal features, Buffalo voice profile, amplitude and pitch perturbation, voice profile questionnaire, hospital anxiety and depression scale, clinical interview schedule, SF-36.\n                Voice therapy improved voice quality as assessed by rating by patients (P=0.001) and rating by observer (P<0.001). The treatment effects for these two outcomes were 4.1 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 6.6) points and 0.82 (0.50 to 1.13) points. Amplitude perturbation showed improvement at six weeks (P=0.005) but not on completion of the study. Patients with dysphonia had appreciable psychological distress and lower quality of life than controls, but voice therapy had no significant impact on either of these variables.\n                Voice therapy is effective in improving voice quality as assessed by self rated and observer rated methods. Forty-five patients diagnosed as having nonorganic dysphonia were assigned in rotation to 1 of 3 groups. Patients in group 1 received no treatment and acted as a control group. Patients in groups 2 and 3 received a program of indirect therapy and direct with indirect therapy, respectively. A range of qualitative and quantitative measures were carried out on all patients before and after treatment to evaluate change in voice quality over time. Results revealed a significant difference between the 3 treatment groups in the amount of change for the voice severity, electrolaryngograph, and shimmer measurements and on ratings provided by a patient questionnaire (P<0.05). However, other measures failed to show significant differences between the 3 groups. Most of the patients (86%) in group 1 showed no significant change on any of the measures.

The study hypothesis was that caffeine reduces the proportion of infants with recurrent hypoxaemic episodes (decrease in transcutaneous PO2 of 20% within 20 s) from 50% to 25%. Transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO2) and heart rate were recorded continuously for 50 h and analysed by computer. The two groups were similar in gestational age, birth weight, delivery mode, sex distribution, and Apgar scores. The mean serum concentration (+/- SD) of caffeine 2 h after the second maintenance dose was 96.0 (+/- 34.5) mumol/l in the group receiving caffeine and 9.3 (+/- 12.8) mumol/l in the group receiving a placebo. The mean proportion of infants with more than six hypoxaemic episodes per 12 h in the caffeine groups was higher (57%) than in the control group (51%). The mean proportion of infants with more than six episodes of bradycardia per 12 h was not statistically different in the caffeine group (79%) from the control group (86%). Our results suggest that prophylactic caffeine has little if any effect on the risk of developing hypoxaemic episodes and bradycardia in small preterm infants and the supposed 50% reduction which was considered clinically important at the start of the trial can be rejected with confidence. To determine whether the benefits of caffeine vary in three subgroups of 2006 participants in the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity (CAP) trial.\n                Post-hoc subgroup analyses were performed on the basis of: (1) indication for commencement of study drug: treat apnea, prevent apnea, or facilitate extubation; (2) positive pressure ventilation (PPV) at randomization: endotracheal tube (ETT), noninvasive ventilation, or none; and (3) timing of commencement of study drug: early or late (< or =3 versus >3 days). Outcomes assessed were those showing treatment effects in the original analyses. We investigated the consistency of caffeine effects by using regression models that incorporated treatment/subgroup factor interactions.\n                There was little evidence of a differential treatment effect of caffeine in subgroups defined by the clinical indication for starting study drug. The size and direction of the caffeine effect on death or disability differed depending on PPV at randomization (P = .03). Odds ratios (95% CI) were: no support, 1.32 (0.81-2.14); noninvasive support, 0.73 (0.52-1.03); and ETT, 0.73 (0.57-0.94). Adjustment for baseline factors strengthened this effect (P = .02). Starting caffeine early resulted in larger reductions in days of respiratory support. Postmenstrual age at time of discontinuing PPV was shorter with earlier treatment (P = .01). Mean differences (95% CI) were: early, 1.35 weeks (0.90-1.81); and late 0.55 weeks (-0.11-0.99).

        "document": "A randomized trial was conducted to test the efficacy and sufficiency of parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) in preventing re-reports of physical abuse among abusive parents. Physically abusive parents (N=110) were randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions: (a) PCIT, (b) PCIT plus individualized enhanced services, or (c) a standard community-based parenting group. Participants had multiple past child welfare reports, severe parent-to-child violence, low household income, and significant levels of depression, substance abuse, and antisocial behavior. At a median follow-up of 850 days, 19% of parents assigned to PCIT had a re-report for physical abuse compared with 49% of parents assigned to the standard community group. Additional enhanced services did not improve the efficacy of PCIT. The relative superiority of PCIT was mediated by greater reduction in negative parent-child interactions, consistent with the PCIT change model.\n                (c) 2004 APA, all rights reserved Weekly reports of high-risk indicators designed to monitor the course of treatment were obtained from physically abused, school-aged children and their parents/guardians who were randomly assigned to Individual Child and Parent Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (CBT) or Family Therapy (FT). Measures of parental anger and physical discipline/force, and family problems were obtained each session. The measures showed moderate stability and parent-child correspondence. Between 20% and 23% of the two informant's reports acknowledged high levels of physical discipline/force during the early and late phases of treatment, respectively, and an even higher percentage of cases reported heightened parental anger and family problems. Early treatment reports from both informants predicted late period reports, but only parent reports were related to validity measures. The overall levels of parental anger and physical discipline/force were lower in CBT than FT families, though each group showed a reduction on these items from the early to late treatment sessions. The importance of routine monitoring of clinical course during intervention, especially in the identification of cases at-risk of reabuse, is discussed. This study examined the effects of the Webster-Stratton parenting program on the parenting skills of maltreating mothers and on the autonomy of their children (3-8 years).\n                A randomized controlled trial was used. Twenty-six maltreating families were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the 16-hour weekly intervention group, or the 4-month wait list control group. Pre- and post-intervention independent assessments included a 2-hour home visit involving videotaped mother-child interactions during two prescribed, 10-minute play activities.\n                Compared to the control group, treatment mothers demonstrated significant improvement in involvement and marginally significant improvement in autonomy-support, but no improvement in structure. Treatment group children showed no significant improvement in autonomy when compared to control group children.\n                This parenting program proved effective with maltreating parents. The lack of demonstrated effect on children may reflect the need for a larger and more sustained treatment dose and/or the need to include parent-child interaction opportunities in the program. At the same time, while treatment gains were limited to the parent, the high treatment adherence rate (92% attended six or more of the eight program sessions) and low attrition rate (n=1) indicate that the treatment gains may hold potential for more thorough examination.",

        "document": "In HIV-1-infected women, poor micronutrient status has been associated with faster progression of HIV-1 disease and adverse birth outcomes. We assessed the effects of vitamin A and multivitamins on birth outcomes in such women.\n                In Tanzania, 1075 HIV-1-infected pregnant women at between 12 and 27 weeks' gestation received placebo (n=267), vitamin A (n=269), multivitamins excluding vitamin A (n=269), or multivitamins including vitamin A (n=270) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design. We measured the effects of multivitamins and vitamin A on birth outcomes and counts of T lymphocyte subsets. We did analyses by intention to treat.\n                30 fetal deaths occurred among women assigned multivitamins compared with 49 among those not on multivitamins (relative risk 0.61 [95% CI 0.39-0.94] p=0.02). Multivitamin supplementation decreased the risk of low birthweight (<2500 g) by 44% (0.56 [0.38-0.82] p=0.003), severe preterm birth (<34 weeks of gestation) by 39% (0.61 [0.38-0.96] p=0.03), and small size for gestational age at birth by 43% (0.57 [0.39-0.82] p=0.002). Vitamin A supplementation had no significant effect on these variables. Multivitamins, but not vitamin A, resulted in a significant increase in CD4, CD8, and CD3 counts.\n                Multivitamin supplementation is a low-cost way of substantially decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes and increasing T-cell counts in HIV-1-infected women. The clinical relevance of our findings for vertical transmission and clinical progression of HIV-1 disease is yet to be ascertained. In observational studies, adequate selenium status has been associated with better pregnancy outcomes and slowed HIV disease progression.\n                We investigated the effects of daily selenium supplements on CD4 cell counts, viral load, pregnancy outcomes, and maternal and infant mortality among 913 HIV-infected pregnant women.\n                In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, eligible women between 12 and 27 wk of gestation were given daily selenium (200 mug as selenomethionine) or placebo as supplements from recruitment until 6 mo after delivery. All women received prenatal iron, folic acid, and multivitamin supplements irrespective of experimental assignment.\n                The selenium regimen had no significant effect on maternal CD4 cell counts or viral load. Selenium was marginally associated with a reduced risk of low birth weight [relative risk (RR) = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.05; P = 0.09] and increased risk of fetal death (RR = 1.58; 95% CI = 0.95, 2.63; P = 0.08), but had no effect on risk of prematurity or small-for-gestational age birth. The regimen had no significant effect on maternal mortality (RR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.51, 2.04; P = 0.96). There was no significant effect on neonatal or overall child mortality, but selenium reduced the risk of child mortality after 6 wk (RR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.99; P = 0.048).\n                Among HIV-infected women from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, selenium supplements given during and after pregnancy did not improve HIV disease progression or pregnancy outcomes, but may improve child survival. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00197561. We previously reported that supplementation with multivitamins (vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and vitamin E) at multiples of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) significantly decreased the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes among HIV-infected women. The minimum dosage of multivitamins necessary for optimal benefits is unknown.\n                We investigated the efficacy of multivitamin supplements at single compared with multiple RDAs on decreasing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes among HIV-infected women.\n                We conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial among 1129 HIV-infected pregnant women in Tanzania. Eligible women between 12 and 27 gestational weeks were randomly assigned to receive daily oral supplements of either single or multiple RDA multivitamins from enrollment until 6 wk after delivery.\n                Multivitamins at multiple and single doses of the RDA had similar effects on the risk of low birth weight (11.6% and 10.2%, respectively; P = 0.75). We found no difference between the 2 groups in the risk of preterm birth (19.3% and 18.4%, respectively; P = 0.73) or small-for-gestational-age (14.8% and 12.0%, respectively; P = 0.18). The mean birth weights were similar in the multiple RDA (3045 + or - 549 g) and single RDA multivitamins group (3052 + or - 534 g; P = 0.83). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the risk of fetal death (P = 0.99) or early infant death (P = 0.19).\n                Multivitamin supplements at a single dose of the RDA may be as efficacious as multiple doses of the RDA in decreasing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes among HIV-infected women. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00197678. In observational studies, the zinc status of HIV-infected persons has been associated with both positive and adverse clinical outcomes. Such endpoints may affect the risk of adverse birth outcomes among HIV-infected women.\n                We examined the effects of zinc supplements on birth outcomes, hematologic indicators, and counts of T lymphocyte subsets among 400 HIV-infected pregnant women.\n                Eligible women between 12 and 27 wk of gestation were randomly assigned to daily oral supplementation with either 25 mg Zn or placebo between recruitment and 6 wk after delivery. All women received iron, folic acid, and multivitamin supplements irrespective of the experimental assignment.\n                We observed no significant differences in birth weight, duration of gestation, or fetal and neonatal mortality between women in the zinc and placebo groups. Hemoglobin concentrations increased between baseline and 6 wk postpartum in both groups. However, the rise in hemoglobin over this period was significantly lower (P = 0.03) in the zinc group (x +/- SD: 11.5 +/- 17.9 g/L) than in the placebo group (15.2 +/- 18.6 g/L). Similarly, the changes in red blood cell count and in packed cell volume over the same period were significantly lower in the zinc group (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively). Zinc had no effect on CD4(+), CD8(+), or CD3(+) cell counts during the follow-up period.\n                Because of the lack of beneficial effects of zinc on adverse pregnancy outcomes and the likelihood of negative effects on hemoglobin concentrations, no compelling evidence exists to support the addition of zinc to prenatal supplements intended for pregnant HIV-infected women.",

        "document": "The nasal and respiratory symptoms observed after oral challenge to aspirin (ASA), tartrazine, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory substances are best described as idiosyncratic reactions. A positive response to oral challenge, defined as a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) from baseline for up to 4 hr, occurred in 44 of 230 patients with ASA, 11 of 277 with tartrazine, 2 of 93 with sodium salicylate, and 2 of 69 with acetaminophen. No one had a positive response to tartrazine, sodium salicylate, or acetaminophen who was not also positive to ASA. The dose of ASA causing a positive response was less than 5 grains in 95% of the patients. Of 50 patients with a suspicious history studied in detail, 96% of those with ASA idiosyncrasy had sinusitis and 71% had nasal polyps. Methacholine challenges and random circulating and sputum eosinophils did not differentiate patients with a negative challenge from those with a positive challenge. However, patients with a positive history and positive challenge had significantly more random nasal eosinophils than those with negative aspirin challenges. The term \"aspirin triad\" has outlived its usefulness since ASA idiosyncrasy can exist in patients lacking certain components of the triad. ASA idiosyncrasy is unsuspected in many patients and possibly overdiagnosed in others. Ten asthmatic children who gave a history of cough or wheeze after orange drinks, were tested for tartrazine sensitivity. On separate days, either oral tartrazine (1 mg) or a placebo capsule were administered double blind. Bronchial reactivity was measured before, 30 and 60 min after ingestion by means of a histamine-inhalation challenge test. There was no change in baseline lung function after tartrazine, but histamine sensitivity (PC20) increased significantly in four of the children. No response was obtained to a larger dose of tartrazine (10 mg) in four of the non-responders. Alteration in the bronchial reactivity after an oral challenge, appears to be a sensitive means of detecting tartrazine sensitivity. This study undertook to determine the usefulness of tartrazine and benzoate challenge and dietary avoidance in the management of patients with chronic asthma. Double-blind ingestion-challenge tests were performed on separate days with lactose, tartrazine, benzoate and acetylsalicyclic acid (ASA). Of the twenty-eight subjects challenged, one responded to tartrazine and one to benzoate. Two additional subjects responded to ASA and a further eight were not tested with this material because of a definite history of sensitivity. Twenty-four subjects completed 1 month periods of observation while first on a normal diet and then while on a tartrazine-benzoate avoidance diet. No improvement occurred during the modified diet in anyone with positive challenge-tests or in all, but one, of those with a history of ASA idiosyncrasy; paradoxically, several of these subjects worsened during this period. We conclude that tartrazine-benzoate dietary avoidance was not of value in the management of the chronic asthmatic in this study, even among patients who respond to challenge with these substances or have ASA idiosyncrasy. One hundred and fifty-six German, Italian and Polish patients with confirmed aspirin-induced asthma underwent open oral challenges with increasing doses of tartrazine up to 25 mg. All positive challenges were repeated under double-blind conditions. Only 4 of 156 patients (all Polish) had positive reactions in a double-blind test, as evidenced by a fall in FEV1 greater than 25% from baseline and corresponding clinical symptoms. Sixty-five patients who tolerated 25 mg tartrazine well received 50-3,000 mg tartrazine and none showed adverse reactions. Thus, intolerance to tartrazine appears to be rare among Central-European and South-European patients with aspirin-induced asthma, its frequency amounting to about 2.6%.",

No overall differences were observed between the 2 groups in the duration of signs of pneumonia. Multiple linear regression showed a significant interaction between basal serum retinol concentration and vitamin A group for the time (in h) to remission of respiratory signs (beta = -3.57, SE = 1.09, P = 0.001). Duration of clinical signs was less in children with basal serum retinol concentrations >200 microg/L who received vitamin A supplements than in children with similar concentrations who received placebo (69.9 +/- 49.9 h compared with 131.3 +/- 143.9 h; P = 0.049).\n                Overall, we found no effect of a moderate dose of vitamin A supplementation on the duration of uncomplicated pneumonia in underweight or normal-weight children aged <5 y. However, a beneficial effect was seen in children with high basal serum retinol concentrations. Vitamin A deficiency and acute lower respiratory tract infections coexist as important public health problems in many developing countries. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to examine whether large doses of vitamin A given to Tanzanian children who are admitted to the hospital with nonmeasles pneumonia would reduce the severity of respiratory disease. Six hundred eighty-seven children were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or vitamin A [200 000 IU (60 mg retinol equivalents) for children > 1 y of age and 100000 IU (30 mg retinol equivalents) for infants] on the day of admission and another dose on the following day. Of the 346 children in the vitamin A group, 13 died in the hospital, compared with 8 of 341 children in the placebo group; the relative mortality was 1.63 (95% CI: 0.67, 3.97; P = 0.28). The mean number of days of hospitalization was the same in both groups (4.2 d). There were no differences between the vitamin A and placebo groups in the duration of hospital stay when examined within categories of children stratified by age, sex, breast-feeding status, nutritional status at baseline, or quartile of dietary vitamin A intake in the 4 mo before admission to the hospital. There were also no differences in the mean number of days of fever, rapid respiratory rate, or hypoxia, whether these endpoints were examined in the total number of subjects or in a subset with more severe clinical conditions at baseline. Large doses of vitamin A had no protective effect on the course of pneumonia in hospitalized Tanzanian children. To evaluate the impact on clinical recovery and severity of the addition of large doses of vitamin A to the standard treatment for childhood pneumonia.\n                A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial.\n                Study children were recruited at a public hospital in Recife, north east Brazil, an area of marginal vitamin A deficiency.\n                472 children aged 6 to 59 months with clinical diagnosis of pneumonia.\n                200,000 IU (infants) or 400,000 IU (1-4 year olds) of vitamin A in oil or similar capsules of placebo divided into two daily oral doses, in addition to the standard treatment.\n                Duration of the episode and incidence of adverse outcomes.\n                The groups were similar with respect to overall duration of pneumonia and incidence of adverse outcomes. Children who received vitamin A, however, were less likely to have fever by day 3 (P = 0.008) and were 29% less likely to fail to respond to the first line antibiotic (P = 0.054).\n                There was little evidence for an effect of vitamin A treatment on the immediate outcome of the pneumonia episode.",

No evidence of the superiority of the combined conditions relative to medication alone was found. Some limited support was found for the hypothesis that the effects of a high dose of psychostimulant medication could be achieved by combining the low dose with a behavioral intervention. The importance of the latter finding is highlighted by the fact that both the benefits and untoward effects of the psychostimulants appear to increase with the dose. Previous studies have demonstrated the short-term efficacy of pharmacotherapy and behavior therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but no longer-term (i.e., >4 months) investigations have compared these 2 treatments or their combination.\n                A group of 579 children with ADHD Combined Type, aged 7 to 9.9 years, were assigned to 14 months of medication management (titration followed by monthly visits); intensive behavioral treatment (parent, school, and child components, with therapist involvement gradually reduced over time); the two combined; or standard community care (treatments by community providers).

Combined and medication management treatments did not differ significantly on any direct comparisons, but in several instances (oppositional/aggressive symptoms, internalizing symptoms, teacher-rated social skills, parent-child relations, and reading achievement) combined treatment proved superior to intensive behavioral treatment and/or community care while medication management did not. Study medication strategies were superior to community care treatments, despite the fact that two thirds of community-treated subjects received medication during the study period.\n                For ADHD symptoms, our carefully crafted medication management was superior to behavioral treatment and to routine community care that included medication.

        "document": "To determine whether noninvasive, nasal synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (nSIMV) improves the likelihood that very low birth weight infants will be successfully extubated.\n                Infants of <1251-g birth weight who were due to be extubated before 6 weeks of age were eligible once they were receiving <35% oxygen and were on a ventilator rate of <18 breaths per minute (bpm). Extubation was performed following intravenous loading with aminophylline, after a successful trial of 12 hours of endotracheal synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation at a rate of 8. Infants were randomized to either nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) at 6 cm H(2)O or nSIMV after extubation. nSIMV was commenced at a rate of 12 bpm with pressure on the ventilator set to achieve a delivered pressure of at least 12 cm H(2)O and a peak end expiratory pressure of 6 cm H(2)O. Continuous recording for diagnosis of apnea was performed for 72 hours after extubation. Objective criteria for failure of extubation were as follows: a PaCO(2) >70; FIO(2) >0.7; or severe recurrent apnea (>2 apneas requiring intermittent positive-pressure ventilation in 24 hours or >6 apneas >20 seconds per day). The study ended after 72 hours postextubation or when infants satisfied failure criteria. A sample size of 54 was determined by power analysis.\n                Mean birth weight (831 standard deviation [SD]: 193 g) and gestation (26.3 SD: 1.8 weeks) did not differ between groups. Mean age at extubation was 7.6 (SD: 9.7) days, range 1 to 40 days. The nSIMV group had a lower incidence of failed extubation 4/27 compared with the continuous positive airway pressure group, 12/27. This was attributable to both a decreased incidence of apnea and a decreased incidence of hypercarbia. There was no increase in the incidence of abdominal distension or feeding intolerance.\n                nSIMV is effective in preventing extubation failure in very low birth weight infants in the first 72 hours after extubation. Noninvasive ventilation may have other roles in the care of the very low birth weight infant. To prospectively compare the incidence of respiratory failure in premature infants randomized to receive either nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure (NPCPAP) or nasopharyngeal-synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (NP-SIMV) in the immediate postextubation period.\n                This is a prospective study of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants randomized at the time of extubation to receive either NPCPAP or NP-SIMV in a university-based level III neonatal intensive care unit. Statistical analysis were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous and ordinal variables, and with the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.\n                A total of 41 VLBW infants were studied; 19 were in the NPCPAP group, and 22 were in the NP-SIMV group. Respiratory failure after extubation in the NP-SIMV group was significantly lower that in the NPCPAP group (5% vs 37%, respectively (p = 0.016). No statistically significant differences between groups with regard to demographics, severity of initial illness and associated complications, time to extubation, ventilatory management before extubation, weight, age, or nutritional status at the time of extubation were noted. To determine whether synchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (SNIPPV) would decrease extubation failure compared with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) in preterm infants being ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).\n                Infants who were </=34 weeks' gestational age and who were ventilated for RDS were randomized to either SNIPPV or NCPAP after extubation. The criteria for extubation were peak inspiratory pressure of </=16 cm H(2)O, positive end expiratory pressure of </=5 cm H(2)O, intermittent mandatory ventilation rate of 15 to 25, and fraction of inspired oxygen </=0.35. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were obtained before extubation. After extubation, blood gases were monitored for a minimum of 72 hours. Success was defined as remaining in the selected mode of treatment or demonstrating improvement (switching to oxyhood/nasal cannula/room air) by 72 hours.\n                Thirty-two (94%) of 34 infants were extubated successfully with the use of SNIPPV versus 18 (60%) of 30 with the use of NCPAP (P <.01). There was no difference in apnea/bradycardia episodes in the 2 groups during the 72-hour study period. Among 55 infants who had PFT, 80% (8 of 10) with dynamic lung compliance of >/=0.5 mL/kg/cm H(2)O and expiratory airway resistance of </=70 cm H(2)O/L/s were extubated successfully. In infants with poor lung function (dynamic lung compliance: <0.5 mL/kg/cm H(2)O; expiratory airway resistance: >70 cm H(2)O/L/s), successful extubation was seen in 93% (27 of 29) in the SNIPPV group and 60% (15 of 25) in the NCPAP group. When weight was controlled for at the time of extubation, the odds of success in the SNIPPV group were 21.1 times higher (95% confidence interval: 3.4, 130.1) than that of the NCPAP group.\n                SNIPPV is more effective than NCPAP in weaning infants with RDS from the ventilator. PFT may be useful in predicting successful extubation.",
        "target_summary": "Implications for practice: NIPPV is a useful method of augmenting the beneficial effects of NCPAP in preterm infants. Its use reduces the incidence of symptoms of extubation failure more effectively than NCPAP. Within the limits of the small numbers of infants randomised to NIPPV there is a reassuring absence of the gastrointestinal side effects that were reported in previous case series.\nImplications for research: Future trials should enroll a sufficient number of infants to detect differences in important outcomes such as chronic lung disease and gastrointestinal perforation. The impact of synchronisation of NIPPV on the technique's safety and efficacy should be established in future trials.",

Findings for 47 infants who were transferred from an incubator to an open crib at >1600 g (early transition group) were compared with those for 47 infants who were transferred from an incubator to an open crib at >1800 g (standard transition [ST] group). The primary outcome of the study was length of stay. Secondary outcomes were the number of infants returned to an incubator, the growth velocity in an open crib and during the first week at home, the proportions of breastfeeding at discharge and during the first week at home, and the hospital readmission rate.\n                The length of stay was significantly shorter in the early transition group than in the standard transition group (23.5 vs 33 days; P=.0002). No infants required transfer back to the incubator. Only 1 infant in the standard transition group was readmitted to the hospital during the first week after discharge. Growth velocities and individual amounts of breastfeeding were similar between the 2 groups.\n                In this study, weaning of moderately preterm infants from incubators to open cribs at 1600 g was safe and resulted in earlier discharge. Thirty pairs of healthy, growing preterm infants were included in this randomized prospective study comparing thermal weaning at 1700 g with that at 1800 g. Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, infants weaned at 1700 g were discharged 1.1 days sooner than those weaned at 1800 g. However, this result was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). On the other hand, differences are apparent between treatments in some strata based on birth weight (p = 0.0056). Evidence also existed that time from entry (at 1500 g) to discharge depended on birth weight stratum (p = 0.010). No infant in either group lost weight after successful weaning, and mean 24-hour weight gains were similar for both groups. Two infants were weaned at 1800 g requiring return to the incubator due to hypothermia, and four infants weaned at 1700 g likewise requiring return to the incubator. The number weaned at 1700 g who had birth weight of 1000 g or less and who developed hypothermia appeared substantial (three of six such infants). Thus, it appears that thermal weaning at 1700 g may be safe and effective only for prematures with birth weight above 1000 g. Additional study appears needed. Fourteen growing, healthy premature infants were moved from heated incubators to cribs at different points in their growth. Group A (six babies) was moved when babies reached a weight of 1,600 to 1,700 gm; group B (eight babies) when babies reached a weight of 1,800 to 1,900 gm. All other conditions of rearing were kept the same. The effect on their growth and thermal stability was measured during the week before and after the temperature change. All infants tolerated the change well. There was no drop in abdominal temperature in an environment cooler by 5 C. The rate of weight gain correlated with gross energy intake only and did not differ within or between the two groups. The rate of growth of the skinfolds increased dramatically after the infants were moved from the incubator. A cooler environment in a growing premature infant (weight greater than 1,600 gm) may promote faster deposition of subcutaneous fat. This might be an important factor in efficient gain in cold resistance.",

Hysteroscopic polypectomy was performed in the study group. Diagnostic hysteroscopy and polyp biopsy was performed in the control group.\n                Total pregnancy rates and time for success in both groups after four IUI cycles were compared by means of contingency tables and life-table analysis. A total of 93 pregnancies occurred, 64 in the study group and 29 in the control group. Women in the study group had a better possibility of becoming pregnant after polypectomy, with a relative risk of 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.5-2.9). Pregnancies in the study group were obtained before the first IUI in 65% of cases.\n                These data suggest that hysteroscopic polypectomy before IUI is an effective measure. This prospective, controlled study was performed in order to evaluate whether the location of uterine fibroids may influence reproductive function in women and whether removal of the fibroid prior to conception may improve pregnancy rate and pregnancy maintenance. We examined 181 women affected by uterine fibroids who had been trying to conceive for at least 1 year without success. The main outcome measures were the pregnancy rate and the miscarriage rate. Among the patients who underwent myomectomy, the pregnancy rates obtained were 43.3% in cases of submucosal, 56.5% in cases of intramural, 40.0% in cases of submucosal-intramural and 35.5% in cases of intramural-subserosal uterine fibroids, respectively. Among the patients who did not undergo surgical treatment, the pregnancy rates obtained were 27.2% in women with submucosal, 41.0% in women with intramural, 15.0% in women with submucosal-intramural and 21.43% in women with intramural-subserosal uterine fibroids, respectively. Although the results were not statistically significant in the group of women with intramural and intramural-subserosal fibroids, this study confirms the important role of the position of the uterine fibroid in infertility as well as the importance of fibroids removal before the achievement of a pregnancy, to improve both the chances of fertilization and pregnancy maintenance.",

Postoperative analgesia was assessed using a linear analogue scale. The time interval between operation and subsequent analgesic administration and the number of analgesic doses in 24 h were compared. The frequency of vomiting was noted. All three methods provided satisfactory results. The only detectable difference between the groups was a more rapid, but transient, recovery in the group receiving plain bupivacaine only. The frequency of vomiting was high in all groups. Caudal analgesia, with or without the addition of morphine, did not confer any advantage over injected diamorphine, and did not justify the extra time, risk and expense required to carry it out. A randomised blind comparison between caudal analgesia (1.5 mg/kg bupivacaine) and intramuscular morphine (0.15 mg/kg) is reported. Forty boys were studied. Caudal analgesia is shown to be significantly better than morphine by means of a linear analogue scale designed to quantify behaviour immediately after operation. Fifty boys presenting for day case circumcision were allocated randomly to receive either caudal analgesia or dorsal nerve block (DNB) to provide postoperative pain relief. Analgesia was assessed by a single, unbiased observer utilising a three-point scale. Subsequently, parents completed a simple questionnaire. Subjects in the DNB group micturated earlier (P less than 0.05) and stood unaided earlier (P less than 0.025) than patients in the caudal group. The incidence of vomiting was significantly lower in the DNB group (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in the duration of analgesia, although that produced in the DNB group tended to wane sooner. It is concluded that DNB provides satisfactory analgesia following circumcision and has specific advantages when compared with caudal analgesia. A clinical trial was performed to compare the effects of intramuscular dihydrocodeine with caudal bupivacaine on postoperative pain and recovery in 181 children who had undergone either circumcision, inguinal herniotomy or orchidopexy performed under general anaesthesia. Linear analogues were used in assess level of consciousness and apparent pain. Recovery of consciousness was slower after caudal analgesia. For 90 minutes following circumcision there was significantly less pain and caudal analgesia, but better pain relief could not be demonstrated following inguinal herniotomy and orchidopexy. To compare caudal and penile block for post-operative analgesia in children undergoing circumcision with respect to efficacy, complication rates, and parental satisfaction.\n                The study population consisted of 100 ASA 1 and 2 boys aged 3 to 8 years who were undergoing circumcision for religious reasons. In all participants, inhalation anesthesia was administered with oxygen : nitrous oxide (1 : 2) and halothane. The participants were allocated randomly into two groups of 50 children each. Group 1 received penile block and Group 2 caudal block. The penile block was achieved by injecting bupivacaine into the two compartments of the subpubic space, with an additional ventral infiltration of a small volume of bupivacaine along the raphe of the penis. For caudal block, 1 ml.kg(-1) body weight of 0.25% bupivacaine was administered.\n                Penile block shortened the induction-incision time and enabled earlier discharge home compared with caudal block. One patient undergoing penile block and nine patients undergoing caudal block vomited.\n                Penile and caudal block are equally effective for postcircumcision analgesia and neither is associated with serious complications. Anesthesiologist preference should be the deciding factor in choosing one technique over the other. In 40 children scheduled for circumcision, we studied the quality and the adverse effects of postoperative analgesia induced by caudal block (group 1) or acetaminophen by rectal route (group 2). Study lasted the six first postoperative hours. In recovery room, analgesia was more effective in group 1. Need of analgesic drugs was also lesser in group 1. Incidence of adverse effects was the same in the two groups. Ketamine has been shown to prolong analgesia produced by caudal local anaesthetic block and is now in common use. This study compares caudal block using bupivacaine/ketamine with dorsal nerve block of the penis.\n                Sixty boys undergoing elective circumcision were given either 0.5 ml x kg-1 of bupivacaine 0.15% with ketamine 0.5 mg x kg-1 (n = 30) or dorsal nerve block of the penis with bupivacaine 0.5% (n = 30) as a supplement to general anaesthesia. Postoperative pain was assessed by parents using a modified objective pain score, and the time taken to first requirement of analgesia was recorded. Motor weakness, time to first micturition, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), eating habits, sleep disturbance and behaviour were also assessed.\n                There was no difference between the groups in time to first requirement for analgesia or number of doses of paracetamol given in the first 24 h. Almost half the boys in the caudal group had motor weakness, and there was a significant increase in time to first micturition in that group. There was no difference between the groups in PONV, eating, sleeping or behavioural disturbance.\n                Caudal anaesthesia with bupivacaine/ketamine does not confer any advantage over a dorsal nerve block with the doses used in this study. Because of the higher incidence of side-effects and technique failure in the caudal group, dorsal nerve block is perhaps the preferred technique.",
        "target_summary": "Differences in the need for rescue or other analgesia could not be detected between caudal, parenteral and penile block methods. In day-case surgery, penile block may be preferable to caudal block in children old enough to walk due to the possibility of temporary leg weakness after caudal block.

There is a need for properly designed trials comparing caudal epidural block with other methods such as morphine, simple analgesics and topical local anaesthetic creams, emulsions or gels.",

Patients controlled on long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy for chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease are excellent surgical candidates and should experience improved symptom control after surgery at 1 year. Both laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) and proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy are established in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The aim of this study was to compare these two treatments in a randomized clinical trial.\n                Between July 1997 and August 2001, 340 patients with a history of GORD for at least 6 months were investigated by endoscopy, 24-h pH monitoring and manometry. Of these, 217 were randomized, 109 to LNF and 108 to PPI therapy. The two groups were well matched for age, sex, weight and severity of reflux. Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring and manometry were performed 3 months after treatment, and quality of life was assessed in both groups using the Psychological General Well-being Index and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale at 3 and 12 months after treatment.\n                At 3 months there was an improvement in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure from 6.3 to 17.2 mmHg in the LNF group but no change in the PPI group (8.1 and 7.9 mmHg before and after treatment respectively) (P < 0.001). The mean DeMeester acid exposure score improved from 42.7 to 8.6 (P < 0.001) in the LNF group and from 36.9 to 17.7 in the PPI group (P < 0.001). The mean gastrointestinal symptom and general well-being scores improved from 31.7 and 95.4 respectively before treatment to 37.0 and 106.2 at 12 months after LNF, compared with changes from 34.3 and 98.5 to 35.0 and 100.4 respectively in the PPI group. The differences in both of these scores were significant between the two groups at 12 months (P = 0.003).\n                LNF leads to significantly less acid exposure of the lower oesophagus at 3 months and significantly greater improvements in both gastrointestinal and general well-being after 12 months compared with PPI treatment.\n                Copyright (c) 2005 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. With the introduction of laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) along with the increasing efficacy of modern medical treatment, a direct comparison is warranted. The 3-year interim results of a randomised study comparing both the efficacy and safety of LARS and esomeprazole (ESO) are reported.\n                LOTUS is an open, parallel-group multicentre, randomised and controlled trial conducted in dedicated centres in 11 European countries. LARS was completed according to a standardised protocol, comprising a total fundoplication and a crural repair. Medical treatment comprised ESO 20 mg once daily, which could be increased stepwise to 40 mg once daily and then 20 mg twice daily in the case of incomplete GORD control. The primary outcome variable was time to treatment failure (Kaplan-Meier analysis). Treatment failure was defined on the basis of symptomatic relapse requiring treatment beyond that stated in the protocol.\n                554 patients were randomised, of whom 288 were allocated to LARS and 266 to ESO. The two study arms were well matched. The proportions of patients who remained in remission after 3 years were similar for the two therapies: 90% of surgical patients compared with 93% medically treated for the intention to treat population, p = 0.25 (90% vs 95% per protocol). No major unexpected postoperative complications were experienced and ESO was well tolerated. However, postfundoplication complaints remain a problem after LARS.\n                Over the first 3 years of this long-term study, both laparoscopic total fundoplication and continuous ESO treatment were similarly effective and well-tolerated therapeutic strategies for providing effective control of GORD.",
        "target_summary": "There is evidence that laparoscopic fundoplication surgery is more effective than medical management for the treatment of GORD at least in the short to medium term. Surgery does carry some risk and whether the benefits of surgery are sustained in the long term remains uncertain. Treatment decisions for GORD should be based on patient and surgeon preference.",

A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess shoulder pain severity whereas shoulder range of movement to the point of pain (SROMP) assessed passive range of movement and pain. Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) and Rankin Disability Index measured functional outcomes.\n                Ninety-eight subjects participated (49 strapped, 49 controls). Intention to treat analysis showed no significant difference in pain, range of movement or functional outcomes after the intervention phase or at the final assessment. However there were trends for less pain at six weeks (VAS, p = 0.11) and better final upper limb function (MAS, p = 0.16) in strapped patients. Skin reactions were uncommon (6.1%). The presence of neglect or sensory loss, but not subluxation, at baseline was independently associated with poor outcome. Range of movement was lost early (mean difference SROMP between hemiplegic and contralateral shoulders at baseline = 15.2 degrees (95% CI 10.9-19.5)) and continued throughout the study. Shoulder strapping did not alter the rate at which range of movement was lost.\n                No significant benefit with shoulder strapping was demonstrated and reasons for this are discussed. Range of movement in the hemiplegic shoulder is lost very early and any preventive treatments need to begin within the first 1-2 days after a stroke.",

Twenty-five patients (16 males, nine females), aged from 3.6 to 26 years (mean 10.5 years), all affected with mental retardation mostly with epileptic seizures, were randomized to oral synthetic fast-release MLT or placebo. Melatonin was initiated at the daily dose of 3 mg, at nocturnal bedtime. In case of inefficacy, MLT dose could be titrated up to 9 mg the following 2 weeks at increments of 3 mg/week, unless the patient was unable to tolerate it. The analysis of all the sleep logs disclosed a significant treatment effect of melatonin on sleep latency (P = 0.019). Melatonin was well tolerated in all patients and no side effects were reported. In conclusion, our study supports the efficacy of MLT in young patients with mental disabilities and epileptic seizures in improving the wake-sleep disorders such as time to fall asleep. Overall, MLT appeared to influence the seizure frequency poorly, though there may be occasional seizure worsening or improving. Such a dual effect requires further studies in young epileptic patients. To investigate whether lamotrigine (LTG) monotherapy is effective and safe for newly diagnosed typical absence seizures in children and adolescents (aged 3-15 years, n = 45).\n                A \"responder-enriched\" study design was used: open-label dose escalation was followed by placebo-controlled, double-blind testing of LTG. Conventional hyperventilation testing with EEG recording was used to confirm diagnoses and assess treatment success defined as complete freedom from seizures. Ambulatory 24-h EEG recordings provided supporting evidence of effectiveness. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events, vital signs, and physical, neurologic, and laboratory examinations. Plasma samples were taken to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of LTG.\n                During initial open-label dose escalation, 71.4% of patients (intent-to-treat) or 82% (per protocol analysis) became seizure free; individual patients responded at doses ranging from 2 to 15 mg/kg/day (median, 5.0). In the placebo-controlled, double-blind phase of the study, statistically significantly more patients remained seizure free when treated with LTG (62%) than with placebo (21%; p < 0.02; for the intent-to-treat analysis). Mean plasma concentrations of LTG, were linearly related to dose, although there was substantial interindividual variation. No patients were withdrawn from the study for any safety-related reason.\n                LTG monotherapy is effective for typical absence seizures in children and is generally well tolerated.",

Patients randomised to intervention received two individual treatment sessions and two telephone follow up calls, supported by a comprehensive educational pack, describing the role of disrupted physiological regulation in fatigue symptoms and encouraging home based graded exercise. The minimum intervention group had no further treatment, but the telephone intervention group received an additional seven follow up calls and the maximum intervention group an additional seven face to face sessions over four months.\n                A score of >/=25 or an increase of >/=10 on the SF-36 physical functioning subscale (range 10 to 30) 12 months after randomisation.\n                21 patients dropped out, mainly from the intervention groups. Intention to treat analysis showed 79 (69%) of patients in the intervention groups achieved a satisfactory outcome in physical functioning compared with two (6%) of controls, who received standardised medical care (P<0.0001). Similar improvements were observed in fatigue, sleep, disability, and mood. No significant differences were found between the three intervention groups.\n                Treatment incorporating evidence based physiological explanations for symptoms was effective in encouraging self managed graded exercise.

Analysis by intention to treat gave similar results (17/33 v 9/33 patients better). Fatigue, functional capacity, and fitness were significantly better after exercise than after flexibility treatment. 12 of 22 patients who crossed over to exercise after flexibility treatment rated themselves as better after completing exercise treatment 32 of 47 patients rated themselves as better three months after completing supervised exercise treatment 35 of 47 patients rated themselves as better one year after completing supervised exercise treatment.\n                These findings support the use of appropriately prescribed graded aerobic exercise in the management of patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome. The Joint Working Group of the Royal Colleges of Physicians, Psychiatrists and General Practitioners (1996) recommended graded exercise and antidepressants for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. We assessed efficacy and acceptability of these treatments.\n                Six-month prospective randomised placebo and therapist contact time controlled trial with allocation to one of four treatment cells: exercise and 20 mg fluoxetine, exercise and placebo drug, appointments only and 20 mg fluoxetine, appointments and placebo drug. Drug treatment was double blind and patients were blind to assignment to exercise or appointments.\n                Ninety-six (71%) of 136 patients completed the trial. Patients were more likely to drop out of exercise than non-exercise treatment (P = 0.05). In an intention to treat analysis, exercise resulted in fewer patients with case level fatigue than appointments only at 26 weeks (12 (18%) v. 4 (6%) respectively P = 0.025) and improvement in functional work capacity at 12 (P = 0.005) and 26 weeks (P = 0.03). Fluoxetine had a significant effect on depression at week 12 only (P = 0.04). Exercise significantly improved health perception (P = 0.012) and fatigue (P = 0.028) at 28 weeks.\n                Graded exercise produced improvements in functional work capacity and fatigue, while fluoxetine improved depression only. To investigate whether 12 weeks of graded exercise with pacing would improve specific physiological, psychological and cognitive functions in people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\n                Randomised controlled trial.\n                Human performance laboratory at the University of Western Australia.\n                61 patients aged between 16 and 74 years diagnosed with CFS.\n                Either graded exercise with pacing (32 patients) or relaxation/flexibility therapy (29 patients) performed twice a day over 12 weeks.\n                Changes in any of the physiological, psychological or cognitive variables assessed.\n                Following the graded exercise intervention, scores were improved for resting systolic blood pressure (P = 0.018), work capacity (W.kg(-1)) (P = 0.019), net blood lactate production (P = 0.036), depression (P = 0.027) and performance on a modified Stroop Colour Word test (P = 0.029). Rating of perceived exertion scores, associated with an exercise test, was lower after graded exercise (P = 0.013). No such changes were observed in the relaxation/flexibility condition, which served as an attention-placebo control.\n                Graded exercise was associated with improvements in physical work capacity, as well as in specific psychological and cognitive variables.

Accordingly, 'nutrition screening tools' have been devised to ensure that all patients are assessed by nurses and, where appropriate, referred to dieticians. The tool adopted in our hospital was the 'Nursing Nutritional Screening Tool'.\n                To investigate the impact of this screening tool on: nutrition-related nursing documentation; patient care at mealtimes; dietician referral.\n                This study was conducted on two similar general medical wards in a United Kingdom (UK) district general hospital, with the help of staff and patients (n = 175) admitted during two study periods, May 1999 and January 2000. Data were collected over 28 days before and after introduction of the screening tool on one of the wards. For both wards, in each stage of the study, data were collected b: review of patients' notes, non-participant observations of mealtimes. Frequencies of dietician referral and documentation of weight were compared by cross-tabulations and chi2 tests. Nine months later, the findings were discussed with ward sisters in a group interview.\n                Introduction of the screening tool impacted on the process but not the outcomes of screening. Use of the screening tool increased the frequency of nutrition-related documentation: the proportion of patients with weights recorded increased on the intervention ward (P < 0.001), and decreased on the comparator ward. Frequency of dietician referral decreased on both wards, but differences were statistically insignificant. There was no observable change in patient care at mealtimes. The nurses in charge of the wards felt that introduction of the screening tool had raised awareness of nutrition-related care.\n                Meeting patients' nutritional needs is a complex aspect of care which may benefit from introduction of structured guidelines. However, the potential of screening tools to improve care is limited by diverse factors, which warrant further exploration. To test the effectiveness of a 10-minute office-staff administered screen to evaluate malnutrition/weight loss, visual impairment, hearing loss, cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, depression, physical limitations, and reduced leg mobility among older persons seen in office practice. This screen was coupled with clinical summaries to assist the physician in further evaluating and managing the screen-included problems.\n                Twenty-six community-based office practices of internists and family physicians in Los Angeles were randomized to intervention or control groups. Two hundred and sixty-one patients aged > or = 70 years and seeing these physicians for a new visit or a physical examination participated in the study. At the enrollment visit intervention group patients were administered the screening measure and their physicians were given the pertinent clinical summaries. Outcome measures were detection of, and intervention for conditions screened, and health status 6 months after the intervention.\n                Hearing loss was both more commonly detected (40% intervention versus 28% control) and further evaluated (29% versus 16%) by physicians in the intervention group (P < 0.05). No other differences in the frequency of problem detection or intervention were noted between groups. Six months after the intervention no differences were noted in health status between groups.\n                A brief measure to screen for common conditions in older persons was associated with more frequent detection and follow-up assessment of hearing loss. Although the measure was well accepted by physicians and their staffs, it did not appear to affect detection and intervention in regard to the other screen-included conditions, or health status at 6 months. In order to reduce protein-energy malnutrition in older people during hospitalisation an early interdisciplinary intervention is needed. We developed a protocol which includes screening for malnutrition, dysphagia and dehydration on admission, followed by immediate interventions.\n                To assess effectiveness of the protocol on nutritional status, hospital-acquired infections and pressure sores, and to evaluate the protocol s economical feasibility.\n                Prospective, controlled study.\n                The inpatient geriatric service of a university hospital (UMC Nijmegen) and a geriatric ward of a non-academic teaching hospital (Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem).\n                298 older patients (>60 years). Methods: One of the geriatric wards applied the protocol (N=140) while the other provided standard care (N=158). All non-terminally ill patients admitted for more than two days were included. Body mass was measured on admittance and discharge and hospital-acquired infections and pressure sores were scored and costs related to nutrition, infections and length of hospital stay were assessed.\n                There was a 0.8 kg loss (SEM 0.3 kg) in average weight in the standard care group and a 0.9 kg gain (SEM 0.2 kg) in the intervention group (p<0.001). The number of hospital acquired infections was significantly lower in the intervention group (33/140 versus 58/158, p=0.01) but no significant difference in number of patients with pressure sores (23/140 versus 33/158) was found. Costs were not significantly different: 7516 versus 7908 Euro/patient for intervention versus controls, respectively.\n                An early interdisciplinary intervention approach can be effective in reducing protein-energy malnutrition and related hospital-acquired infections and appears to be economically feasible.",

        "document": "The effectiveness of ongoing rehabilitation services for postacute stroke survivors is poorly documented. We designed a randomized control, single-blinded study to demonstrate the effectiveness of intensive outpatient therapy. The treatment intervention consisted of 1 hr each of physical and occupational therapy, four times per week, for 12 wk; therapy focused on neuromuscular facilitation and functional tasks. All subjects were screened before the therapies and after 3 mo and 9 mo. Forty-nine stroke survivors, who were at least l yr (mean, 2.9 yr) poststroke, were randomized with two treated patients to each control (no treatment supplied). All patients had received inpatient rehabilitation at the time of their acute stroke, but no patient had any ongoing therapy within the last 6 mo. The outcome measures included the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery, timed mobility tasks, and the Jebson hand evaluation. We also evaluated the level of depression, self-esteem, and socialization. The treated patients demonstrated an improvement of 6.6 points over the 3 mo of therapy compared with only 1.5 points in the control group in the FIM motor score transformed using Rasch analysis. The change from time 0 to 3 mo was significant in the treated group but not in the controls. Treated patients maintained their gains at the 9-mo follow-up, and controls lost ground. The treated group improved in terms of socialization and self-esteem as evidenced by a lower Sickness Impact Profile, whereas the controls tended to get worse. There was a trend toward less depression, but this did not reach a P = 0.05 level of significance. This study demonstrates that significant functional gains can still be attained in the postacute stroke survivor, despite prior inpatient rehabilitation services. To determine whether the intervention of a physiotherapist improved mobility in patients seen more than one year after stroke.\n                Randomised crossover trial comparing two groups offered intervention by a physiotherapist, one immediately after entry into the trial and the other after a delay of three months. The intervention consisted of identifying problems and offering advice and help to solve the problems.\n                Patients' homes in Oxfordshire.\n                Patients who had reduced mobility due to a stroke more than one year before entry; 60 were recruited from a community stroke register and 34 in other ways.\n                Standard measures of mobility including gait speed, functional ambulation categories, the Nottingham extended activities of daily living index, and individual items from the Barthel activities of daily living index and the Frenchay activities index. Measures of manual dexterity, depression, and anxiety were used as controls.\n                94 patients entered the trial and 49 were randomised to immediate and 45 to delayed physiotherapy; 89 were compared at the crossover point. At randomisation the two groups were comparable. At three months the group given early therapy showed an improvement in gait speed whereas the untreated group had declined (differences of -3.9 v 6.4 s to walk 10 m; p less than 0.01); between three and six months the group given delayed therapy showed improvement and the previously treated group declined (differences of 6.5 v -3.9 s to walk 10 m; p less than 0.01). A 9% (95% confidence interval 0% to 18%) decrease in time taken to walk 10 m was associated with treatment and a 12% (2% to 19%) increase when patients were untreated. Other measures did not change significantly.\n                Intervention of an experienced physiotherapist late after stroke specifically improves mobility, albeit by a small amount, but the effects do not seem to be maintained, perhaps because there is an underlying decline in mobility in these patients. Gait speed offers a simple and sensitive measure of outcome. A pilot evaluation of an occupational therapy intervention to improve self-care independence for residents with stroke-related disability living in care homes was the basis of this study.\n                A cluster randomized controlled trial with care home as the unit of randomization was undertaken in Oxfordshire, UK. Twelve homes (118 residents) were randomly allocated to either intervention (6 homes, 63 residents) or control (6 homes, 55 residents). Occupational therapy was provided to individuals but included carer education. The control group received usual care. Assessments were made at baseline, postintervention (3 months) and at 6-months to estimate change using the Barthel Activity of Daily Living Index (BI) scores, \"poor global outcome\", (defined as deterioration in BI score, or death) and the Rivermead Mobility Index.\n                At 3 months BI score in survivors had increased by 0.6 (SD 3.9) in the intervention group and decreased by 0.9 (2.2) in the control group; a difference of 1.5 (95% CI allowing for cluster design, -0.5 to 3.5). At 6 months the difference was 1.9 (-0.7 to 4.4). Global poor outcome was less common in the intervention group. At 3 months, 20/63 (32%) were worse/dead in the intervention group compared with 31/55 (56%) in the control group, difference -25% (-51% to 1%). At 6 months the difference was similar, -26% (-48% to -3%). Between-group changes in Rivermead Mobility Index scores were not significantly different.\n                Residents who received an occupational therapy intervention were less likely to deteriorate in their ability to perform activities of daily living.",

At 2 weeks, there was no significant difference in outcome between the two groups. Co-trimoxazole is much less expensive than ampicillin or procaine penicillin, requires only twice-daily administration, and can be given by health-care staff with little training. The results support the use of co-trimoxazole as the antibiotic of first choice in outpatient management of young children with pneumonia in developing countries. Injectable penicillin is the recommended treatment for WHO-defined severe pneumonia (lower chest indrawing). If oral amoxicillin proves equally effective, it could reduce referral, admission, and treatment costs. We aimed to determine whether oral amoxicillin and parenteral penicillin were equivalent in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children aged 3-59 months.\n                This multicentre, randomised, open-label equivalency study was undertaken at tertiary-care centres in eight developing countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. Children aged 3-59 months with severe pneumonia were admitted for 48 h and, if symptoms improved, were discharged with a 5-day course of oral amoxicillin. 1702 children were randomly allocated to receive either oral amoxicillin (n=857) or parenteral penicillin (n=845) for 48 h. Follow-up assessments were done at 5 and 14 days after enrollment. Primary outcome was treatment failure (persistence of lower chest indrawing or new danger signs) at 48 h. Analyses were by intention-to-treat and per protocol.\n                Treatment failure was 19% in each group (161 patients, pencillin; 167 amoxillin; risk difference -0.4%; 95% CI -4.2 to 3.3) at 48 h. Infancy (age 3-11 months; odds ratio 2.72, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.79), very fast breathing (1.94, 1.42 to 2.65), and hypoxia (1.95, 1.34 to 2.82) at baseline predicted treatment failure by multivariate analysis.\n                Injectable penicillin and oral amoxicillin are equivalent for severe pneumonia treatment in controlled settings.

In a 12 wk double-blind randomized crossover study, we assessed the effects of supplemental air and oxygen on exercise performance (step tests and 6 min walking distance [6MWD]) initially and after two 6 wk periods at home using exertional cylinder air or oxygen. We measured quality of life at baseline and after the two 6 wk domiciliary periods. The 26 patients (24 males) had a mean age of 73 +/- 6 yr; mean FEV1, 0.9 +/- 0.4 L; mean DLCO, 10.6 +/- 2.4 ml/min/mm Hg; mean resting PO2, 69 +/- 8.5 (range 58 to 82) mm Hg; mean PCO2, 41 +/- 3.3 mm Hg; and mean resting SaO2, 94 +/- 2.1 (mean +/- SD). Laboratory tests were performed breathing intranasal air or oxygen at 4 L/min, and measurements were made of SaO2 and Borg dysnea scores. Supplemental oxygen increased 6MWD and steps by small, statistically significant increments acutely at baseline and after 6 and 12 wk, without corresponding falls in Borg score. Degree of desaturation at baseline did not correlate with increase in 6MWD or steps achieved at baseline or at 6 or 12 wk, nor with the domiciliary gas used. There was no difference in 6MWD or steps achieved while breathing supplemental oxygen after 6 wk of domiciliary oxygen compared with domiciliary air. Small improvements in quality of life indices were found after domiciliary oxygen, and mastery also improved after domiciliary air.

        "document": "1. In order to verify the hypothesis that risperidone is a useful therapeutic alternative to clozapine the authors carried out a randomized double blind trial in 59 patients with paranoid hallucinatory psychoses. 2. In a treatment lasting 28 days three groups of patients received either 4 mg risperidone (N = 20), 8 mg risperidone (N = 19), or 400 mg clozapine (N = 20) daily. 3. The tolerance of 4 mg risperidone was globally assessed as being better than that of 400 mg clozapine. Drop-outs under clozapine were mostly caused by side effects, whereas under risperidone they tended to occur for therapeutic inefficacy. 4. The antipsychotic effect was highly significant and clinically relevant under both risperidone and clozapine. Blockade of dopamine D2 receptors remains a common feature of all antipsychotics. It has been hypothesized that the extrastriatal (cortical, thalamic) dopamine D2 receptors may be more critical to antipsychotic response than the striatal dopamine D2 receptors. This is the first double-blind controlled study to examine the relationship between striatal and extrastriatal D2 occupancy and clinical effects. Fourteen patients with recent onset psychosis were assigned to low or high doses of risperidone (1 mg vs 4 mg/day) or olanzapine (2.5 mg vs 15 mg/day) in order to achieve a broad range of D2 occupancy levels across subjects. Clinical response, side effects, striatal ([11C]-raclopride-positron emission tomography (PET)), and extrastriatal ([11C]-FLB 457-PET) D2 receptors were evaluated after treatment. The measured D2 occupancies ranged from 50 to 92% in striatal and 4 to 95% in the different extrastriatal (frontal, temporal, thalamic) regions. Striatal and extrastriatal occupancies were correlated with dose, drug plasma levels, and with each other. Striatal D2 occupancy predicted response in positive psychotic symptoms (r=0.62, p=0.01), but not for negative symptoms (r=0.2, p=0.5). Extrastriatal D2 occupancy did not predict response in positive or negative symptoms. The two subjects who experienced motor side effects had the highest striatal occupancies in the cohort. Striatal D2 blockade predicted antipsychotic response better than frontal, temporal, and thalamic occupancy. These results, when combined with the preclinical data implicating the mesolimbic striatum in antipsychotic response, suggest that dopamine D2 blockade within specific regions of the striatum may be most critical for ameliorating psychosis in schizophrenia.",
        "target_summary": "There is still lack of strong evidence for an optimal dose for clinical practice. The quality of trials suggests that an over estimate of effect is likely and we think this is most probably for the mid-range doses. One such dose (standard-lower dose range, 4-<6 mg/day) does seem optimal for clinical response and adverse effects. Weak evidence suggests that low doses (\u22672-<4 mg/day) may be of value for people in their first episode of illness. High doses (\u226710 mg/day) did not confer any advantage over any other dose ranges and caused more adverse effects, especially for movement disorders. Ultra low dose (<2 mg/day) seemed useless. We advise the use of dosages from low dose to standard-lower dose for different kinds of individual patients. Future trials should focus on specific populations, e.g. those in their first episode, with acute exacerbation, in relapse or refractory to treatment, and should also test the optimal dose of risperidone over a longer period of time and in the community.",

        "document": "A hospital's change from a traditional, multitiered incident-reporting system for medication errors to a standardized, nonpunitive medication-use variance process is described. After weaknesses were identified in the hospital's system for reporting and evaluating medication errors, a multidisciplinary task force was formed to redesign the hospital's medication error-reporting system. Its guiding principles were as follows: anonymity and freedom from punitive action are essential for increasing the number of reports, rating medication errors facilitates identification of areas for system improvement, potential errors provide valuable insight into the system's vulnerabilities, and timely review of reports enables rapid systematic correction. To support the intended nonpunitive culture, the term medication-use variance was used in lieu of medication error for any unplanned event that deviates from the intended course of prescribing, dispensing, administering, or monitoring medications. A one-page medication-use variance report was developed that prompted the reporter for key data elements, including root causes, patient outcomes, and possible ways to prevent similar incidents. The most difficult decision for the task force was deciding whether the process should be anonymous. After getting the support of the medical-legal counsel and the quality improvement department for an anonymous reporting process, the task force agreed to test it in the department of pharmacy and in three patient units in September 1998. A paper-driven reporting process was selected initially because an electronic system would not be truly anonymous. The number of reports from these units increased compared with historical trends, and for the first time potential errors were reported. The report form was easy to use and improved the interpretation of reports. Despite these positive results, task force members remained divided on the issue of anonymity but ultimately embraced the nonpunitive culture. In the first six months following hospitalwide implementation, the number of events captured increased more than fivefold; it continues to increase. The resulting database serves as a trigger for quality improvement efforts and a measure of their effectiveness. The redesign of the medication error-reporting process served as the impetus for a change in the organizational culture surrounding medication errors. Baylor University Medical Center (Dallas) converted patient occurrence reporting from a paper form to a custom-built Web-based system that used the medical center's intranet. DEVELOPING THE WEB-BASED SYSTEM: Non-medication patient occurrences were documented manually on paper forms known as incident reports, and medication variances were entered electronically. The medical center had used the same paper form for many years, without any interim updates or revisions. With a delay of more than a week in receiving forms, the process was not efficient or timely. In addition, paper forms were sometimes illegible or incomplete.\n                The project team, representing the Center for Quality and Care Coordination and information services, decided that the best approach would be a phased implementation based on development of system functionality and a facility's readiness for conversion. Reporting was to be conducted in terms of 10 standardized patient occurrence reporting categories.\n                Comparison of quarterly data pre- and post-Web forms showed an 83.5% increase in number of submissions and a 79.5% reduction in event-to-submission time. Web forms also eliminated paper form limitations of legibility, completeness, and security.\n                It is still an individual responsibility to report and then transform collected data into usable information, which will drive process improvement. Technology can make an important contribution to these efforts, but the culture of the organization must have a complete program strategy. The focus must shift to reporting as a cornerstone to quality and safety and away from traditional notions of error and blame. To design a Web-based system to track adverse and near-miss events, to establish an automated method to identify patterns of events, and to assess the adverse event reporting behavior of physicians.\n                A Web-based system was designed to collect physician-reported adverse events including weekly Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) entries and anonymous adverse/near-miss events. An automated system was set up to help identify event patterns. Adverse event frequency was compared with hospital databases to assess reporting completeness.\n                A metropolitan tertiary care center.\n                Identification of adverse event patterns and completeness of reporting.\n                From September 2005 to August 2007, 15,524 surgical patients were reported including 957 (6.2%) adverse events and 34 (0.2%) anonymous reports. The automated pattern recognition system helped identify 4 event patterns from M&M reports and 3 patterns from anonymous/near-miss reporting. After multidisciplinary meetings and expert reviews, the patterns were addressed with educational initiatives, correction of systems issues, and/or intensive quality monitoring. Only 25% of complications and 42% of inpatient deaths were reported. A total of 75.2% of adverse events resulting in permanent disability or death were attributed to the nature of the disease. Interventions to improve reporting were largely unsuccessful.\n                We have developed a user-friendly Web-based system to track complications and identify patterns of adverse events. Underreporting of adverse events and attributing the complication to the nature of the disease represent a problem in reporting culture among surgeons at our institution. Similar systems should be used by surgery departments, particularly those affiliated with teaching hospitals, to identify quality improvement opportunities.",

For 14 days, patients recorded pain levels twice daily using a visual analogue scale. Analgesic uses, as well as any complications, were also noted by the patients.\n                Thirty-seven patients completed the study, 21 in the treatment group and 16 in the control group. Mean postoperative days of pain were 10.3 and 8.3, respectively, and differed significantly (p = .008). Mean postoperative days of analgesic use were 9.0 and 6.7, respectively, and differed significantly (p = .005). Only one incidence of postoperative hemorrhage occurred in the study group.\n                In our study, the H2O2 mouth rinse does not provide a better analgesic effect than the water rinse for post-tonsillectomy pain relief. The use of benzydamine hydrochloride pump spray as a post-operative analgesic in children undergoing tonsillectomy was assessed in a double-blind trial in 56 subjects of ages ranging from 4-11 years. The raw tonsil bed was sprayed before the childrens' mealtimes and the appraisal of post-operative pain was made on the soreness of the throat as assessed by child, parent and surgeon; also assessed were the degree of referred earache, the ability of the child to swallow without discomfort, and the macroscopic appearance of the healing tonsillar bed. Results showed that the benzydamine spray was more effective than placebo in the control of post-operative pain. To compare the administration of bupivacaine hydrochloride, dexamethasone and lidocaine hydrochloride in decreasing post-tonsillectomy pain.\n                Eighty patients were enrolled in the study in ENT Clinic, Firat University, and in ENT Clinic Elazi\u011f SSK Hospital, Elazi\u011f (Turkey). Children between 6 and 14 years of age referred to our department for bilateral tonsillectomy for either recurrent tonsillitis or tonsillar hypertrophy. Data from 80 patients were analyzed. The first group had bupivacaine hydrochloride. The second group had dexamethasone infiltrated around each tonsil. The third group was given equal doses of 10% lidocain hydrochloride sprayed on the tonsillectomy fossa four times a day, and a placebo group received 9% NaCl applied to the tonsillar fossa four times a day. Pain scores, determined by visual analog scale, were obtained in the first, third and seventh postoperative days.\n                Pain scores in the postoperative period were identical in the first, third and seventh postoperative days. According to VAS results the groups were compared on the basis of postoperative pain. In the first postoperative day, the difference between bupivacaine-placebo, dexamethasone-placebo and lidocaine-placebo groups was found to be statistically significant (P<0.05). Nevertheless the difference between bupivacaine-dexamethasone, bupivacaine-lidocaine and dexamethasone-lidocaine were not significant (P>0.05). In the third postoperative day, the difference between bupivacaine and lidocaine group found to be statistically significant (P<0.05).

These three medicines can be used to reduce pain for children during the postoperative period applied tonsillectomy during the post-operative period. But lidocaine was more preferable, reducing pain in the third postop day better than bupivacaine.

Prophylaxis was started preoperatively and continued for 10 days. The standard fracture treatment consisted of operative stabilization, mostly by means of plates or external fixators. In the cloxacillin group two infections were observed as compared to 12 in the control group. This difference was significant. A prospective trial was undertaken on 85 adult patients with open fractures of the distal phalanges of less than 6 hours duration, treated by conventional surgery. They either received no antibiotic therapy, or cephradine in short or long courses. The infection rate was 30% in the group without antibiotics and less than 3% in the treated groups. Three different antibiotics regimes were compared, with no difference in the infection rate: therefore the simplest and surest method, a single pre-operative dose and a single post-operative dose, is recommended. The role of antibiotics was investigated prospectively in 91 open fractures of the finger. Antibiotics were administered to alternate patients with open phalangeal fractures. Only finger fractures distal to the metacarpophalangeal joint were included. Both groups were treated with aggressive surgical irrigation and debridement. In four patients in each group clinical signs of infection eventually developed; osteomyelitis did not develop in any patients, and no secondary surgical procedures were required in either group. This data indicates that vigorous irrigation and debridement is adequate primary treatment for open phalangeal fractures in fingers with intact digital arteries. We have investigated the efficacy of intravenous antibiotic therapy as a prophylactic measure to prevent infection following low-velocity gunshot fractures. Ninety-six consecutive patients were randomized prospectively to either an antibiotic group (Group I) or a nonantibiotic group (Group II) and were followed in a special gunshot wound clinic. Only patients with fractures that could be treated by closed techniques and did not require internal fixation were included. Sixty-seven patients (73 fractures) were followed radiographically. At follow-up, 36 fractures in Group 1 and 37 fractures in Group II comprised the study group. A total of two infections, one in each group, was documented. No significant infection prophylaxis was demonstrated by the use of intravenous antibiotics in these injuries. The value of prophylactic antibiotics in fracture surgery was studied in a series of 90 patients with open fractures of various bones and 180 patients with closed malleolar fractures treated by open surgery. Dicloxacillin and benzyl penicillin were compared to saline (placebo). The soft tissue lesions of the open fractures were divided into Grade I wounds and Grade II & III wounds. Of the patients with Grade I wounds, 17 received dicloxacillin, 21 benzyl penicillin and 17 saline. No major infections occurred. Twelve patients with Grade II & III wounds were treated with dicloxacillin, 10 with benzyl penicillin and 13 with saline. In the saline group, 2 patients developed a deep infection. Fifty-eight patients with closed malleolar fractures received dicloxacillin, 59 benzyl penicillin and 63 saline. Two infections developed in the placebo group. A statistically significant difference was found between the number of infections in the antibiotic groups and the number in the placebo group.

Individual patients not physically able to withstand surgery may be treated with primary radiotherapy.",

        "document": "Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a physiological mechanism whereby brief ischemia-reperfusion episodes attenuate damage by subsequent prolonged ischemic insults. It reduces myocardial injury following cardiac and aortic aneurysm surgery. We aimed to determine whether RIPC affects neurological or cardiac injury following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Patients were preconditioned using 10 minutes of lower limb ischemia-reperfusion. The primary neurological outcome was saccadic latency deterioration. The primary cardiac outcome measure was increased in serum troponin I >0.15 mg/dL. In all, 70 patients were randomized, of whom 55 completed the neurological surveillance protocol. Although there were fewer saccadic latency deteriorations in the RIPC arm, this did not reach statistical significance (32% versus 53%; P = .11). The primary cardiac outcome occurred in 1 patient in each arm (P = .97). There were no adverse events related to the preconditioning protocol. Remote ischemic preconditioning appears safe in patients with CEA. Large-scale trials are required to determine whether RIPC confers clinical benefits. To report a randomized clinical trial designed to determine if remote ischemic preconditioning (IP) has the ability to reduce renal and cardiac damage following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\n                Forty patients (all men; mean age 76+/-7 years) with abdominal aortic aneurysms averaging 6.3+/-0.8 cm in diameter were enrolled in the trial from November 2006 to January 2008. Eighteen patients (mean age 74 years, range 72-81) were randomized to preconditioning and completed the full remote IP protocol; there were no withdrawals. Twenty-two patients (mean age 76 years, range 66-80) were assigned to the control group. Remote IP was induced using sequential lower limb ischemia. Serum and urinary markers of renal and cardiac injury were compared between the groups.\n                Urinary retinol binding protein (RBP) levels increased 10-fold from a median of 235 micromol/L to 2356 micromol/L at 24 hours (p = 0.0001). There was a lower increase in the preconditioned group, from 167 micromol/L to 413 micromol/L at 24 hours (p = 0.04). The median urinary albumin:creatinine ratio was significantly lower in the preconditioned group at 24 hours (5 versus 8.8, p = 0.06). There were no differences in the rates of renal impairment or major adverse cardiac events.\n                Remote preconditioning reduces urinary biomarkers of renal injury in patients undergoing elective EVAR. This small pilot trial was unable to detect an effect on clinical endpoints; further trials are warranted. We aimed to determine whether remote ischemic preconditioning (IP) reduces renal damage following elective open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Sequential common iliac clamping was used to induce remote IP in randomized patients. Urinary retinol binding protein (RBP) and albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) were measured following induction and 3, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. In controls (n = 22), median urinary RBP increased from 112 microg/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 96-173 microg/mL) preoperatively to 5919 microg/mL (IQR 283-17 788 microg/mL) at 3 hours. Preoperative urinary RBP in preconditioned patients was 96 microg/mL (IQR 50 to 229 microg/mL) preoperatively, rising to 1243 microg/mL (IQR 540 to 15400 microg/mL) at 3 hours. Although control patients' median urinary RBP level was 5 times greater at 3 hours, there were no statistically significant differences in renal outcome indices. This trial could not confirm that remote IP reduces renal injury following elective open aneurysm surgery. Myocardial and renal injury commonly contribute to perioperative morbidity and mortality after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomenon whereby brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion in one organ provide systemic protection from prolonged ischemia. To investigate whether remote preconditioning reduces the incidence of myocardial and renal injury in patients undergoing elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, we performed a randomized trial. METHOD AND RESULTS; Eighty-two patients were randomized to abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with RIPC or conventional abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (control). Two cycles of intermittent crossclamping of the common iliac artery with 10 minutes ischemia followed by 10 minutes reperfusion served as the RIPC stimulus. Myocardial injury was assessed by cardiac troponin I (>0.40 ng/mL), myocardial infarction by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association definition and renal injury by serum creatinine (>177 micromol/L) according to American Heart Association guidelines for risk stratification in major vascular surgery. The groups were well matched for baseline characteristics. RIPC reduced the incidence of myocardial injury by 27% (39% versus 12% [95% CI: 8.8% to 45%]; P=0.005), myocardial infarction by 22% (27% versus 5% [95% CI: 7.3% to 38%]; P=0.006), and renal impairment by 23% (30% versus 7%; [95% CI: 6.4 to 39]; P=0.009). Multivariable analysis revealed the protective effect of RIPC on myocardial injury (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.67; P=0.008), myocardial infarction (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.75; P=0.006) and renal impairment were independent of other covariables.\n                In patients undergoing elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, RIPC reduces the incidence of postoperative myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, and renal impairment.",

        "document": "Our study was undertaken to evaluate if desensitization treatment is more effective than rechallenge in preventing hypersensitivity reactions in HIV-positive patients with previous allergic reactions to TMP-SMX; the secondary aim was to evaluate the frequency of reactions to TMP alone. This was a randomized, multicentre open study. Patients with previous documented hypersensitivity to TMP-SMX who required primary or secondary PCP prophylaxis were enrolled; subjects who had previously had serious adverse reactions to TMP-SMX were excluded. All eligible patients assumed 200 mg TMP for 14 days and in case of no reactions were randomized for desensitization or rechallenge with TMP-SMX. The patients were then followed up by periodical visits for six months. Seventy-three patients were enrolled; 14 subjects (19%) presented reactions on TMP alone during the pre-enrollment phase. The remaining 59 subjects were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups: 34 carried out desensitization (group 1) and 25 rechallenge (group 2) with TMP-SMX. Seven patients in group 1 (20.5%) and seven in group 2 (28%) showed hypersensitivity reactions during treatment; this difference was not statistically significant. No serious reaction occurred in either group. This study showed the comparable effectiveness of the desensitization procedure and rechallenge in patients with a previous, not serious, allergic reaction to TMP-SMX. Sulfonamides are drugs extensively used in the management of AIDS patients. However, the use of sulfonamides is often associated with the development of allergic reactions, provoking the substitution of the drug (by another that may be less effective); alternatively attempts are made to desensitize the patient.\n                Compare two drug regimens (full vs. escalating doses) for the oral desensitization of AIDS patients allergic to sulfonamides.\n                AIDS patients with previous allergic reactions to sulfonamides and requiring prophylaxis against Pneumocistis carinii, central nervous system toxoplasmosis and diarrhea caused by Isospora belli were randomly assigned to a group receiving a routine dose of cothrimoxazole, or another that received escalating doses of an oral suspension of the same drug, initiating with 75 mg/day of sulfamethoxazole that was doubled every 48 hours till the full dose was reached, if no allergic reaction occurred. Patients were monitored for at least 6 months after enrollment in the trial. The major end-point was the ability to maintain prophylactic treatment after that period of time. Plasma viral load (PVL) and CD(4)/CD(8) counts were measured at baseline. Liver enzymes and hematological parameters were measured at baseline and after 1, 3 and 6 months.\n                Eighteen patients were enrolled in the study (15 men and 3 women), with ages ranging from 30 to 57 years (mean 39.9). The mean CD(4) counts were slightly higher for patients receiving a full dose; there was also a trend towards higher baseline CD(8) counts among patients developing new reactions. The mean PVL was similar among the patients in both desensitization groups. The incidence of new allergic reactions was identical (40%) in the two groups. All adverse reactions were mild and no significant increase in liver enzymes were observed.\n                Dose regimen is not a predictor of the development of new allergic reactions amongst patients challenged with sulfonamides after an initial allergic reaction. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is the most effective Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylactic agent, but adverse reactions are common among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and limit its use. This randomized, double-blind controlled trial compared 2 methods of TMP-SMZ reintroduction, 6-day dose escalation and direct rechallenge, for PCP prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients who had experienced previous treatment-limiting reactions. The primary end point was the ability to take single-strength TMP-SMZ daily for 6 months. Seventy-five percent of the dose-escalation group and 57% of the direct-rechallenge group continued to receive daily single-strength TMP-SMZ for 6 months (P= .014). Among premature discontinuations, 58% of the dose-escalation group and 70% of the direct-rechallenge group were due to adverse reactions. None of these reactions was serious. This study provides evidence that it is possible to successfully reintroduce TMP-SMZ to a significant proportion of HIV-infected patients who have experienced mild-to-moderate treatment-limiting adverse reactions.",
        "target_summary": "In the small trials included in this review, when compared to cotrimoxazole rechallenge for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, cotrimoxazole desensitization resulted in fewer treatment discontinuations and overall adverse reactions in HIV-infected patients with a previous history of mild or moderate hypersensitivity to cotrimoxazole. Paediatric data and trials in resource-poor settings are urgently required. Further randomised controlled trials are also needed for the treatment of opportunistic infections, treating-through, adjunctive medications, and different desensitization-dosing schedules.",

        "document": "In a randomized prospective trial, we studied the effect of early high-dose phenobarbital treatment on the early (intraventricular hemorrhage) and late (neurodevelopmental abnormalities) manifestations of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in preterm infants weighing 1500 g or less at birth. The first intravenous dose of 15 mg/kg was given at a mean age of 110 minutes, followed by 15 mg/kg after 4 hours and then by 5 mg/kg at 24-hour intervals for 5 days. The overall incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage was 32% in treated and 46% in control infants, a nonsignificant difference. An ultrasound brain scan at 9 months old revealed no significant difference in the incidence of ventricular dilatation between treated (19%) and control (29%) infants. At 27 months, a similar incidence of mild (10%) and severe (10%) neurodevelopmental handicaps was found in both treated and control groups. Since beneficial effects could not be documented by any of the criteria used, we conclude that routine administration of phenobarbital to low birth weight infants is not justified. The use of prophylactic phenobarbital to reduce motor activity and intraventricular hemorrhage was investigated in a controlled exploratory trial with 19 low birthweight premature infants with respiratory disease. Although phenobarbital significantly suppressed movement, it was associated with an increased incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Phenobarbital-treated infants were over eight times more likely to experience IVH than were untreated infants. These data indicate that inhibition of motor activity by phenobarbital may not alleviate the key pathogenetic factors in IVH. Forty-two premature infants less than 24 hours of age, with normal admission echoencephalograms, were randomly assigned to control or phenobarbital treatment groups. Infants in the treated group received two loading doses of 10 mg/kg of phenobarbital 12 hours apart, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.5 mg/kg every 12 hours for 6 days. Serial echoencephalograms were obtained in both groups. The groups were comparable with regard to birth weight, gestational age, and potential risk factors for subependymal-intraventricular hemorrhage. Ten infants (48%) in each group developed hemorrhage. The hemorrhages in the phenobarbital-treated group were significantly less severe than those in the control group. The phenobarbital-treated infants who bled, however, were also significantly larger and more mature than control infants who bled. The results of this study indicate no effect of phenobarbital on the incidence of subependymal-intraventricular hemorrhage, but a possible beneficial effect on the severity of hemorrhage. During an eight-months period, we studied every newborns under 34 gestation weeks who needed mechanical ventilation (MV) from the moment they were born and whom had an ultrasonogram without intraventricular hemorrhage in the first six hours after birth. Patient were separated in two groups: the first, a group of 30 patients received phenobarbital 20 mg/kg IV in the first 6 hours of life and then 2.5 mg/kg, I.V., every 12 hours for the next five days. Blood levels were measured 24 and 96 hours after the initial dose was given. The second group of 30 patients was not treated with phenobarbital. In both groups a brain ultrasonogram was made every 48 hours until 15 days of life. There were no difference in weight, gestational age, Apgar score, way of birth, initial diagnosis, incidence of pneumothorax, mortality and days with MV between the two groups. During the first three days were measured blood glucose, blood pressure, mean airway pressure, PCO2, PO2 and found no significant difference between both groups. The blood pH showed statistically significant difference, with better values at 48-72 hours in the group treated with phenobarbital. The global incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage was 16 (53%) in the group treated and 14 (46%) in the not treated, this difference was not statistically significant. The degree of hemorrhage, found was: I and II degree, eleven (69%) in the treated group and four (28%), in the control group; III and IV degree five (31%), in the treated group and ten (71%), in the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Prematurely born infants with intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) suffer significant morbidity and mortality, particularly those infants with high grade haemorrhage. The more premature infants have a higher incidence, experiencing more severe IVH. The etiology of IVH is clearly multifactorial. Prevention, both prenatal and postnatal. These include efforts to prevent preterm delivery. Postnatally, the importance of optimal resuscitation and neonatal care practices is stressed, particularly those which minimize cerebral blood flow fluctuation. 130 premature infants of less than 32 weeks gestation with a very low birth weight (VLBW) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) were studied. They were divided in four groups: group I (n=35) received Indocid; group II (n=42) received Indocid and Phenobarbital; group III (n=53) received Indocid and Phenobarbital; surfactant. These three groups were compare to a reference group (n=45). Newborns from the main group were given Indocid 0.1 mg/kg from 6-12 h of life and during next three days, Phenobarbital 5 mg/kg first five days after delivery and surfactant in the first 4 hours of life according to the protocol provided with the specific surfactant replacement product. Cerebral netrasaund in 24 hours, day 3, 5 and 10 of life and follow up till one year age were performed. We found that IVH/PVH percentage is lowest in newborns from group III, followed by newborns from group II and group I.",

Because this agent has been shown to improve outcomes in coronary artery disease, there is interest to evaluate whether it could improve cerebral perfusion and outcomes after ischemic stroke. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of abciximab in acute ischemic stroke and to obtain pilot efficacy data.\n                We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial. Seventy-four eligible and consenting patients presenting within 24 hours after ischemic stroke onset at 38 study sites were randomly allocated to receive either an escalating dose of abciximab (54 patients) or placebo (20 patients) in a ratio of 3:1. We studied 4 escalating doses of abciximab. Patients underwent a scheduled follow-up head CT scan 24 to 36 hours after the completion of study agent administration to monitor for bleeding complications and were evaluated through 3 months.\n                There were no cases of major intracranial hemorrhage. Asymptomatic parenchymal hemorrhages were detected on post-study agent CT in 4 of 54 abciximab patients (7%) and in 1 of 20 placebo patients (5%). Six additional abciximab patients had asymptomatic hemorrhagic lesions detected by unscheduled brain imaging during their follow-up period. Nine of 11 patients with asymptomatic hemorrhage had a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >14. At 3 months, there was a trend toward a higher rate of minimal residual disability (Barthel Index > or =95 or modified Rankin scale < or =1) among abciximab patients compared with those who received placebo.\n                Abciximab appears to be safe when administered up to 24 hours after stroke onset, and it might improve functional outcome. Because of its success in treatment of acute cardiac ischemia, there is interest in the use of abciximab for treating patients with acute ischemic stroke. A previous dose-escalation study determined that abciximab could be given safely in a regimen of 0.25 mg/kg intravenous bolus followed by a 12-hour infusion at 0.125 microg/kg per minute (maximum 10 microg/min). This study was performed to obtain more information about the safety and potential efficacy of abciximab in patients with stroke.\n                An international randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial enrolled 400 patients within 6 hours of onset of ischemic stroke. The primary safety outcome was the rate of symptomatic hemorrhage that occurred during the first 5 days after stroke. The primary efficacy measure was the distribution of outcomes at 3 months after stroke using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) based on an ordinal regression model of outcomes, adjusting for baseline severity of stroke, age, and interval from stroke.\n                Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 5 days was diagnosed in 7 of 195 (3.6%) patients treated with abciximab and 2 of 199 (1%) patients given placebo (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; P=0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7 to 25.9). Asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation was detected by brain imaging in 24 patients administered abciximab and 33 patients receiving placebo (OR, 0.74; P=0.25; 95% CI, 0.4 to 1.3). Treatment with abciximab showed a nonsignificant shift in favorable outcomes as measured by mRS scores at 3 months (OR, 1.20; P=0.33; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.70).\n                Intravenously administered abciximab can be given to patients with a reasonable degree of safety. The trial also suggests that abciximab could improve outcomes at 3 months after stroke. A larger randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is necessary to test the efficacy of abciximab.",

The study group was given 1-3 injections of 1 ml of an aluminium-phosphate-adsorbed tetanus toxoid more than 6 weeks apart, and the control group a similar number of injections of an influenza-virus vaccine.There was no statistically significant difference between those in the two groups given one injection. Those in the control group given 2 or 3 injections had a tetanus neonatorum death rate of 7.8 deaths per 100 births, and the corresponding subjects in the study group had none. This difference is unlikely to have occurred by chance. Immunization of non-pregnant women in rural Bangladesh with two doses of aluminium-adsorbed tetanus-diphtheria toxoids reduced neonatal mortality by one-third during a period of 9-32 months after vaccination. The reduction in mortality rate was attributable almost entirely to a 75% lower mortality rate among 4-14-day-old infants, when tetanus was the predominant cause of death.In the period up to 20 months following vaccination, the reduction in deaths among 4-14-day-old infants after a single dose of tetanus-diptheria toxoids was about the same as that after two doses.

The patients were randomly divided into two groups: 638 were assigned not to undergo preoperative evaluation based on routine medical tests and electrocardiograms; the other 638 underwent preoperative evaluation based on said tests. Ophthalmologic and systemic complications were assessed intraoperatively and 1 month after surgery.\n                Eleven intraoperative complications occurred in the group without preoperative tests and eight in the group with preoperative tests; at 1 month six complications were recorded in the group without tests and five in the group with tests. Systemic adverse events occurred intraoperatively in four patients, whereas no systemic adverse event was recorded at 1 month in either group. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups.\n                The findings of this study have broad applicability, because the sample is representative of the population existing in numerous social and healthcare settings; they are of value for administrative purposes, because they may be taken as reference in resource allocation plans; and they have medicolegal implications, as the resulting conduct of healthcare providers is supported by a rigorous scientific study. Routine preoperative medical testing is commonly performed in patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery, although the value of such testing is uncertain. We performed a study to determine whether routine testing helps reduce the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative medical complications.\n                We randomly assigned 19,557 elective cataract operations in 18,189 patients at nine centers to be preceded or not preceded by a standard battery of medical tests (electrocardiography, complete blood count, and measurement of serum levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose), in addition to a history taking and physical examination. Adverse medical events and interventions on the day of surgery and during the seven days after surgery were recorded.\n                Medical outcomes were assessed in 9408 patients who underwent 9626 cataract operations that were not preceded by routine testing and in 9411 patients who underwent 9624 operations that were preceded by routine testing. The most frequent medical events in both groups were treatment for hypertension and arrhythmia (principally bradycardia). The overall rate of complications (intraoperative and postoperative events combined) was the same in the two groups (31.3 events per 1000 operations). There were also no significant differences between the no-testing group and the testing group in the rates of intraoperative events (19.2 and 19.7, respectively, per 1000 operations) and postoperative events (12.6 and 12.1 per 1000 operations). Analyses stratified according to age, sex, race, physical status (according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification), and medical history revealed no benefit of routine testing.\n                Routine medical testing before cataract surgery does not measurably increase the safety of the surgery. The objective of this study was to investigate whether routine medical testing before cataract surgery reduces the rate of complications during the perioperative period in adults.\n                The study was carried out in an academic medical center in Brazil, between 10 February 2000 and 10 January 2001. The scheduled cataract operations were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) to be preceded by routine testing (the \"routine-testing group\") or 2) not to be preceded by routine medical testing (the \"selective-testing group\"). If the patient was assigned to the selective-testing group, it was requested that no preoperative testing be performed unless the patient presented with a new or worsening medical problem that would warrant medical evaluation with testing. In the case of patients assigned to the routine-testing group, three tests were requested: a 12-lead electrocardiogram, a complete blood count, and measurements of serum glucose.\n                The sample of 1,025 patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery was comprised of 512 assigned to the routine-testing group and of 513 assigned to the selective-testing group. The two groups had similar proportions of operations canceled and not subsequently rescheduled, 2% in each group. The cumulative rate of medical events was similar in the two groups, 9.6% in the routine-testing group and 9.7% in the selective-testing group (P = 0.923). The types of medical events were also similar in both groups.\n                The results of this study suggest that routine medical testing before cataract surgery does not reduce the rate of complications during the perioperative period. The results also suggest it would be more efficient not to request routine preoperative tests unless indicated by patient history or physical examination.",
        "target_summary": "This review has shown that routine pre-operative testing does not increase the safety of cataract surgery. Alternatives to routine preoperative medical testing have been proposed, including self-administered health questionnaires, which could substitute for health provider histories and physical examinations.\u00a0Such avenues may lead to cost-effective means of identifying those at increased risk of medical adverse events due to cataract surgery.\u00a0However, despite the rare occurrence, adverse medical events precipitated by cataract surgery remain a concern because of the large number of elderly patients with multiple medical comorbidities who have cataract surgery in various settings. The studies summarized in this review should assist recommendations for the standard of care of cataract surgery, at least in developed settings.\u00a0Unfortunately, in developing country settings, medical history questionnaires would be useless to screen for risk since few people have ever been to a physician, let alone been diagnosed with any chronic disease.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study of this kind where the possible benefits of surface heparinization of the VVBP circuit in OLT have been investigated. Twenty patients were randomized to either heparin-coated (HC) VVBP equipment or to otherwise identical noncoated (NC) circuits. Five blood samples were drawn during the OLT procedure: one just before VVBP, three during VVBP and one 5 min after portal venous reperfusion (PVR). A further sample was taken 1 day after the operation. Components of the blood coagulation, fibrinolytic and kallikrein-kinin systems were analysed using functional assays (chromogenic peptide substrate assays) or enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Complement system factors and granulocyte activation, represented by myeloperoxidase (MPO) release, were analyzed by EIA. Activation of the plasma defence systems occurred in both groups at an early stage during OLT and a further activation occurred 5 min after PVR. MPO levels were slightly elevated 5 min after PVR. However, no significant differences between the two groups were observed. Significant activation of the humoral defense systems was found in both groups during OLT. A considerably larger study, including at least 330 patients, is necessary to fully assess the possible benefits of surface heparinization of the VVBP circuit. Although venovenous bypass (VVBP) has been suggested to protect the kidneys during liver transplantation and its systematic use has therefore been recommended, this beneficial effect of VVBP has not been clearly demonstrated. In a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, 77 patients receiving liver transplants for chronic liver disease were allocated to be supported with VVBP (group 1, 38 patients) or not (group 2, 39 patients). Both groups were similar in relation to preoperative clinical and laboratory data and operative transfusion requirements. Inulin clearance and urinary beta(2)-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) excretion (to determine glomerular filtration rate and tubular damage, respectively) were measured at different perioperative periods (anesthesia induction, hepatectomy, anhepatic phase, biliary anastomosis, and 24 hours after surgery). A significant decrease in inulin clearance and increase in tubular damage markers were observed in the anhepatic phase, which only partly improved in the subsequent phases. No significant differences were observed between groups 1 and 2 at any perioperative phase, except during the anhepatic phase, in which a more marked renal function impairment occurred in group 2 patients. However, renal function on the 7th postoperative day and the need for hemodialysis/ hemofiltration during the 1st week were similar in both groups. Among 40 variables analyzed, only low mean arterial pressure at anesthesia induction was identified as an independent predictor for early postoperative severe renal failure (inulin clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at the 24th postoperative hour), with no significant relationship between this complication and the use of venovenous bypass. Renal function markedly deteriorates during liver transplantation, and renal impairment persists during the early postoperative period. Because VVBP support is not associated with any clear benefit in renal function, its systematic use does not seem to be justified. Lactate determinations did not contribute to the quantification of the systemic and regional tissue oxygenation during OLT. Venous stasis was not an important factor in the tissue imbalance between oxygen supply and oxygen demand.",

        "document": "Thirty hypertensive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were divided randomly into two groups. The treated group was begun on preliminary volume expansion, and control of hypertension was carried out using vasodilators and centrally acting drugs. The control group was treated in the classical manner for hypertension, with a diuretic as the foundation for therapy. The incidence of clinical vasospasm was compared to that of angiographic spasm. The incidence of preoperative vasospasm in the treated group was 20%, as compared to 60% in the untreated group (P less than 0.01). Of the treated group, 87% survived to operation, whereas only 53% of the control group survived to operation (P less than 0.01). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and symptomatic vasospasm is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Volume expansion has been reported to increase CBF after SAH, but CBF values in hypervolemic (HV) and normovolemic (NV) subjects have never been directly compared.\n                On the day after aneurysm clipping, we randomly assigned 82 patients to receive HV or NV fluid management until SAH day 14. In addition to 80 mL/h of isotonic crystalloid, 250 mL of 5% albumin solution was given every 2 hours to maintain normal (NV group, n=41) or elevated (HV group, n=41) cardiac filling pressures. CBF ((133)xenon clearance) was measured before randomization and approximately every 3 days thereafter (mean, 4.5 studies per patient).\n                HV patients received significantly more fluid and had higher pulmonary artery diastolic and central venous pressures than NV patients, but there was no effect on net fluid balance or on blood volume measured on the third postoperative day. There was no difference in mean global CBF during the treatment period between HV and NV patients (P=0.55, random-effects model). Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 20% of patients in each group and was associated with reduced minimum regional CBF values (P=0.04). However, there was also no difference in minimum regional CBF between the 2 treatment groups.\n                HV therapy resulted in increased cardiac filling pressures and fluid intake but did not increase CBF or blood volume compared with NV therapy. Although careful fluid management to avoid hypovolemia may reduce the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia after SAH, prophylactic HV therapy is unlikely to confer an additional benefit. To investigate the role of prophylactic hyperdynamic postoperative fluid therapy in preventing delayed ischemic neurological deficits attributable to cerebral vasospasm.\n                We designed a prospected, randomized, controlled study and included 32 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Sixteen patients received hypervolemic hypertensive hemodilution fluid therapy; the other 16 patients received normovolemic fluid therapy. All patients were monitored for at least 12 days, with clinical assessments, transcranial Doppler recordings, single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) scanning, and routine computed tomographic scanning. For fluid balance monitoring, a number of blood samples were obtained on a daily basis and continuous central venous pressure and mean arterial blood pressure measurements were performed for both groups. All patients received intravenous nimodipine infusions between Day 1 and Day 12. End points of this study were clinical outcomes, clinically evident and transcranial Doppler sonography-evident vasospasm, SPECT findings, complications, and costs. Clinical examinations (using the Glasgow Outcome Scale) performed 1 year after discharge, together with neuropsychological assessments and SPECT scanning, were the basis for the evaluation of clinical outcomes.\n                No differences were observed between the two groups with respect to cerebral vasospasm (as observed clinically or on transcranial Doppler recordings). When regional cerebral blood flow was evaluated by means of SPECT analysis performed on Day 12 after subarachnoid hemorrhage, no differences were revealed. One-year clinical follow-up assessments (with the Glasgow Outcome Scale), including SPECT findings and neuropsychological function results, did not demonstrate any significant group differences. Costs were higher and complications were more frequent for the hyperdynamic therapy group.\n                Neither early nor late outcome measures revealed any significant differences between the two subarachnoid hemorrhage treatment models.",

        "document": "A previous placebo-controlled trial has shown that biodegradable 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers (Gliadel wafers) prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. A previously completed phase 3 trial, also placebo controlled, in 32 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma also demonstrated a survival benefit in those patients treated with BCNU wafers. Because of the small number of patients in that trial, a larger phase 3 trial was performed to confirm these results. Two hundred forty patients were randomized to receive either BCNU or placebo wafers at the time of primary surgical resection; both groups were treated with external beam radiation postoperatively. The two groups were similar for age, sex, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and tumor histology. Median survival in the intent-to-treat group was 13.9 months for the BCNU wafer-treated group and 11.6 months for the placebo-treated group (log-rank P -value stratified by country = 0.03), with a 29% reduction in the risk of death in the treatment group. When adjusted for factors affecting survival, the treatment effect remained positive with a risk reduction of 28% ( P = 0.03). Time to decline in KPS and in 10/11 neuroperformance measures was statistically significantly prolonged in the BCNU wafer-treated group ( P </= 0.05). Adverse events were comparable for the 2 groups, except for CSF leak (5% in the BCNU wafer-treated group vs. 0.8% in the placebo-treated group) and intracranial hypertension (9.1% in the BCNU wafer-treated group vs. 1.7% in the placebo group). This study confirms that local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers is well tolerated and offers a survival benefit to patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. Chemotherapy for brain tumours has been limited because of difficulty in achieving adequate exposure to the tumour without systemic toxicity. We have developed a method for local sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents by their incorporation into biodegradable polymers. Implantation of the drug-impregnated polymer at the tumour site allows prolonged local exposure with minimal systemic exposure. We conducted a randomised, placebo-controlled, prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of biodegradable polymers impregnated with carmustine to treat recurrent malignant gliomas. In 27 medical centres, 222 patients with recurrent malignant brain tumours requiring re-operation were randomly assigned to receive surgically implanted biodegradable polymer discs with or without 3.85% carmustine. Randomisation balanced the treatment groups for all of the prognostic factors examined. Median survival of the 110 patients who received carmustine polymers was 31 weeks compared with 23 weeks for the 112 patients who received only placebo polymers (hazard ratio = 0.67, p = 0.006, after accounting for the effects of prognostic factors). Among patients with glioblastoma, 6-month survival in those treated with carmustine-polymer discs was 50% greater than in those treated with placebo (mortality = 32 of 72 [44%] vs 47 of 73 [64%], p = 0.02). There were no clinically important adverse reactions related to the carmustine polymer, either in the brain or systemically. Interstitial chemotherapy delivered with polymers directly to brain tumours at the time of surgery seems to be a safe and effective treatment for recurrent malignant gliomas. To find out the effect of carmustine (bischloroethyl-nitrosourea) combined with a biodegradable polymer in the treatment of malignant (Grades III and IV) gliomas, applied locally, at the time of the primary operation.\n                Prospective, randomized double-blind study of an active treatment group versus a placebo group. Conducted at the Departments of Neurosurgery of the University Hospitals of Helsinki, Tampere, and Turku in Finland and Trondheim in Norway. The study consisted of 32 patients (16 in each treatment group) enrolled between March 23, 1992, and March 19, 1993. The study was planned to include 100 patients but had to be terminated prematurely, because the drug that was being used had become unobtainable. The main outcome measures included the survival times of patients after the operations and the application of an active drug or placebo.\n                The median time from surgery to death was 58.1 weeks for the active treatment group versus 39.9 weeks for the placebo group (P = 0.012). For 27 patients with Grade IV tumors, the corresponding times were 39.9 weeks for the placebo group and 53.3 weeks for the active treatment group (P = 0.008). At the end of the study, six patients were still alive, five of whom belonged to the active treatment group.\n                Carmustine applied locally in a biodegradable polymer at the time of primary operation, seems to have a favorable effect on the life span of patients with high-grade gliomas. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy increases survival of primary malignant glioma patients beyond 12-18 months. The only interstitial chemotherapy treatment approved for malignant glioma is Gliadel wafer containing carmustine (BCNU) placed in the resection cavity at surgery. Analysis of a large trial by Westphal and colleagues (n = 240) showed a 29% risk reduction (P = 0.03) in the BCNU wafer-treated group over the course of the 30-month trial. Long-term follow-up of these patients was undertaken to determine the survival benefit at 2 and 3 years.\n                Survival proportions for the placebo and treatment groups over the 56-month study were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multiple-regression analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model included prognostic factors of age, KPS, and tumor type. A secondary analysis was conducted for 207 GBM patients.\n                Of the 59 patients available for long-term follow-up, 11 were alive at 56 months: 9 had received BCNU wafers and 2 had received placebo wafers. Median survival of patients treated with BCNU wafers was 13.8 months vs 11.6 months in placebo-treated patients (P = 0.017) with a hazard ratio of 0.73 (P = 0.018), representing a 27% significant risk reduction. This survival advantage was maintained at 1, 2, and 3 years and was statistically significant (P = 0.01) at 3 years. Two of 207 GBM patients remained alive at the end of the follow-up period, both in the BCNU wafer-treated group.\n                Malignant glioma patients treated with BCNU wafers at the time of initial surgery in combination with radiation therapy demonstrated a survival advantage at 2 and 3 years follow-up compared with placebo.",

Concurrent drugs included carbamazepine (CBZ). The interfering effects of the pharmacokinetic interaction between REM and CBZ were offset by the monitoring of plasma CBZ concentration and the appropriate reduction of CBZ dose by an unblinded observer.\n                Patients taking CBZ entered a 4-week run-in period to stabilise their dosage regimen to Tegretol tablets and blinded capsules containing Tegretol tablets. They then entered an 8-week baseline period during which variation of plasma CBZ concentration was used to derive an individual Shewart Control Chart for each patient. These charts were used to define the threshold for CBZ dose reduction after the addition of trial drug.

Substantial increases in plasma CBZ concentration, which would have confounded the results of the trial, were thus avoided.

        "document": "A crossed-design experimental study has been made involving simple blind paired data and random assignment to treatment, with the aim of evaluating the action of an occlusal splint with transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) upon the manifestations of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in patients with bruxism. The prevalence of TMD in the 24 patients with bruxism was 62.5%%; the corresponding severity, as determined by the pantographic reproducibility index (PRI), was mild (mean value: 20.71). Clicking and pain in the lateral pterygoid muscle were the most frequent clinical manifestations. The occlusal splint and TENS did not significantly improve the signs and symptoms of TMD in these patients with bruxism. The efficacy of occlusal splints in diminishing muscle activity and tooth-grinding damage remains controversial. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of an occlusal splint (OS) vs. a palatal control device (PCD). Nine subjects with sleep bruxism (SB) participated in this randomized study. Sleep laboratory recordings were made on the second night to establish baseline data. Patients then wore each of the splints in the sleep laboratory for recording nights three and four, two weeks apart, according to a crossover design. A statistically significant reduction in the number of SB episodes per hour (decrease of 41%, p = 0.05) and SB bursts per hour (decrease of 40%, p < 0.05) was observed with the two devices. Both oral devices also showed 50% fewer episodes with grinding noise (p = 0.06). No difference was observed between the devices. Moreover, no changes in respiratory variables were observed. Both devices reduced muscle activity associated with SB. Bruxism occurs in nearly 60% of children between 3 and 5 years, with important repercussions to the different components of the stomatognathic system. Nevertheless, there is little information in the literature about this topic. The aim of this study was to compare two groups of children with bruxism. One group was not submitted to treatment, serving as a control. To the other group, nocturnal bite plate was made. Cast models were made for both groups, to evaluate the progression of wear facets, during 8 months. The results are as follows: The 4 children of the control group displayed increased wear facets during the study period. On the other hand, of the 5 children that used nocturnal bite plate, showed no increase of wear facets, even after the removal of the device. From this study, we can conclude that the use of nocturnal bite plate is efficient against bruxism in 3- to 5-year-old children. To assess the efficacy of occlusal stabilization splints in the management of sleep bruxism (SB) in a double-blind, parallel, controlled, randomized clinical trial.\n                Twenty-one participants were randomly assigned to an occlusal splint group (n = 11; mean age = 34.2 +/- 13.1 years) or a palatal splint (ie, an acrylic palatal coverage) group (n = 10; mean age = 34.9 +/- 11.2 years). Two polysomnographic recordings that included bilateral masseter electromyographic activity were made: one prior to treatment, the other after a treatment period of 4 weeks. The number of bruxism episodes per hour of sleep (Epi/h), the number of bursts per hour (Bur/h), and the bruxism time index (ie, the percentage of total sleep time spent bruxing) were established as outcome variables at a 10% maximum voluntary contraction threshold level. A general linear model was used to test both the effects between splint groups and within the treatment phase as well as their interaction for each outcome variable.\n                Neither occlusal stabilization splints nor palatal splints had an influence on the SB outcome variables or on the sleep variables measured on a group level. In individual cases, variable outcomes were found: Some patients had an increase (33% to 48% of the cases), while others showed no change (33% to 48%) or a decrease (19% to 29%) in SB outcome variables.\n                The absence of significant group effects of splints in the management of SB indicates that caution is required when splints are indicated, apart from their role in the protection against dental wear. The application of splints should therefore be considered at the individual patient level. The objective of this experimental study was to compare the effect on sleep bruxism and tooth-grinding activity of a double-arch temporary custom-fit mandibular advancement device (MAD) and a single maxillary occlusal splint (MOS).\n                Thirteen intense and frequent bruxors participated in this short-term randomized crossover controlled study. All polygraphic recordings and analyses were made in a sleep laboratory. The MOS was used as the active control condition and the MAD was used as the experimental treatment condition. Designed to temporarily manage snoring and sleep apnea, the MAD was used in 3 different configurations: (1) without the retention pin between the arches (full freedom of movement), (2) with the retention pin in a slightly advanced position (< 40%), and (3) with the retention pin in a more advanced position (> 75%) of the lower arch. Sleep variables, bruxism-related motor activity, and subjective reports (pain, comfort, oral salivation, and quality of sleep) were analyzed with analysis of variance and the Friedman test.\n                A significant reduction in the number of sleep bruxism episodes per hour (decrease of 42%, P < .001) was observed with the MOS. Compared to the MOS, active MADs (with advancement) also revealed a significant reduction in sleep bruxism motor activity. However, 8 of 13 patients reported pain (localized on mandibular gums and/or anterior teeth) with active MADs.\n                Short-term use of a temporary custom-fit MAD is associated with a remarkable reduction in sleep bruxism motor activity. To a smaller extent, the MOS also reduces sleep bruxism. However, the exact mechanism supporting this reduction remains to be explained. Hypotheses are oriented toward the following: dimension and configuration of the appliance, presence of pain, reduced freedom of movement, or change in the upper airway patency.",
        "target_summary": "There is not sufficient evidence to state that the occlusal splint is effective for treating sleep bruxism. Indication of its use is questionable with regard to sleep outcomes, but it may be that there is some benefit with regard to tooth wear. This systematic review suggests the need for further investigation in more controlled RCTs that pay attention to method of allocation, outcome assessment, large sample size, and sufficient duration of follow up. The study design must be parallel, in order to eliminate the bias provided by studies of cross-over type. A standardisation of the outcomes of the treatment of sleep bruxism should be established in the RCTs.",

Social stories are a means of incorporating an individual with autism's propensity toward visual learning with educationally necessary behavior modifications. Participants in the study were four first- and second-grade students with a primary diagnosis of autism attending an elementary school in eastern Iowa. A unique social story was created for each student that addressed a current behavioral goal. Subsequently, original music was composed using the text of the social story as lyrics. The independent variable for this study was one of three treatment conditions: baseline (A); reading the story (B); and singing the story (C). The reading and singing versions of the social stories were alternately presented to the students using the counterbalanced treatment order ABAC/ACAB. The dependent variable was the frequency with which the target behavior occurred under each condition of the independent variable. Data were collected for a period of 1 hour following presentation of the social story. Results from all four cases indicated that both the reading condition (B) and the singing condition (C) were significantly (p <.05) more effective in reducing the target behavior than the no-contact control condition (A). The singing condition was significantly more effective than the reading condition only in Case Study III. For the remaining case studies, the mean frequency of the target behavior was smaller during the singing condition, but not significantly so. These results suggested that the use of a musically adapted version of social stories is an effective and viable treatment option for modifying behaviors with this population.",

No adverse response to ceftazidime was noted, and the incidence of later candidiasis was similar to that after other broad-spectrum antibiotic combinations. The avoidance of gentamicin assay in the ceftazidime group was an advantage in this age group.",

Patients were 18 mo to 42 y of age (geometric mean, 10.2 y), and the 19 patients in each group were comparable on admission. All patients received intravenous quinine therapy. Four patients (21%) in each group died. There were no significant differences between the placebo- and dexamethasone-treated groups in time until patients became afebrile (median, 51 vs. 19 h), the level of consciousness became normal (mean, 80 vs. 83 h), or parasitemia was cleared (mean, 2.1 vs. 3.4 d) or in the incidence of complications. Coma or hyperparasitemia (greater than or equal to 5% of erythrocytes parasitized) at the time of admission and hypoglycemia at any time during hospitalization were significantly correlated with a fatal outcome, which was not improved by using dexamethasone. We conclude that high-dose dexamethasone is not indicated for treating cerebral malaria. High-dose dexamethasone was compared with placebo in a double-blind trial involving 100 comatose patients with strictly defined cerebral malaria. The two treatment groups, whose members were six to 70 years old, proved comparable on admission. There were eight deaths in the dexamethasone group and nine in the placebo group (no significant difference; P = 0.8); at post-mortem examination the brain showed features diagnostic of cerebral malaria in all but one patient who died. Dexamethasone prolonged coma among the survivors: the interval between the start of treatment and the full recovery of consciousness was 63.2 +/- 5.9 hours (mean +/- S.E.M.) in the dexamethasone group, as compared with 47.4 +/- 3.2 hours in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Complications, including pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding, occurred in 26 patients given dexamethasone and 11 given placebo (P = 0.004). Only five patients had neurologic sequelae.

There is, however, little evidence for the effectiveness of these approaches.\n                Twenty-four men and 6 women aged 17 to 25 years (mean +/- SD, 18.7 +/- 1.2 years) participated in the study. Subjects were randomly and exclusively assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: patella taping combined with a standardized exercise program, placebo patella taping and exercise program, or exercise program alone (n = 10 in each group). Taping was applied and exercises performed on a daily basis for 4 weeks. Outcome measures were visual analog scales for pain and the functional index questionnaire, recorded at weekly intervals by a therapist who was blinded to group allocation.\n                Separate mixed-model ANOVAs, with repeated measures on time, indicated statistically significant improvements in pain and function over time for all groups (P<.01) and also significant differences between groups for all measures (P<.01). Separate independent samples t tests showed that the group receiving taping and exercises had better pain and function scores following treatment than the placebo taping-and-exercise group and the exercise-alone group. There were no significant differences between the placebo taping-and-exercise group and exercise-alone group at any time point.\n                These findings indicate that over a period of 4 weeks a combination of daily patella taping and exercises was successful in improving pain and function in individuals with patellofemoral pain syndrome. The combination of patella taping and exercise was superior to the use of exercise alone. To determine the efficacy of the individual components of physiotherapy in subjects with anterior knee pain.\n                An observer blind, prospective, factorial design randomised controlled trial. 81 young adults with anterior knee pain were randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: (1) exercise, taping, and education; (2) exercise and education; (3) taping and education; and (4) education alone. Each group received six physiotherapist-led treatments over three months. Follow up took place at three months using the following outcome measures: patient satisfaction (discharge/refer for further treatment); a visual analogue pain score; the WOMAC lower limb function score; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD); and quadriceps strength. At 12 months the WOMAC and HAD were assessed by postal questionnaire.\n                All groups showed significant improvements in WOMAC, visual analogue, and HAD scores; these improvements did not vary significantly between the four groups or between exercising/non-exercising and taped/non-taped patients at three and 12 months. However, patients who exercised were significantly more likely to be discharged at three months than non-exercising patients (chi(2), p<0.001). Taping was not significantly associated with discharge. Significantly greater improvements in WOMAC, visual analogue, and the anxiety score (but not the depression score) were seen in patients who were discharged than in those who were referred.\n                The proprioceptive muscle stretching and strengthening aspects of physiotherapy have a beneficial effect at three months sufficient to permit discharge from physiotherapy. These benefits are maintained at one year. Taping does not influence the outcome. Quadriceps strengthening, quadriceps stretching and patellar taping are commonly prescribed together for patellofemoral pain patients. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of each of these techniques in isolation for one week and in combination for one week.\n                A prospective double-blind randomized control study was designed involving 41 subjects with 60 knees diagnosed with patellofemoral pain. The knees were randomized in onto one of four groups (n = 15): infrapatellar taping, quadriceps strengthening, quadriceps stretching and control. The taping was worn continually for the week; the strengthening group followed a programme of non-weight-bearing terminal range quadriceps exercises, the stretching group performed rectus femoris stretches. The control group did not receive treatment. All subjects received advice. Seven pre- and post-treatment measures included isokinetic quadriceps strength, quadriceps length, pain measured during four activities and maximum eccentric, posturally controlled, pain-free knee flexion angle during a step-down. Results showed significant changes over time (p < 0.01) in two out of seven measures for the taping group, in five out of seven for the strengthening group and five out of seven for the stretching group and none in the control group. When the three modalities were combined for one week, (n = 60) all seven measures improved significantly (p < 0.01).\n                In isolation, quadriceps stretching and quadriceps strengthening resulted in more improvements than taping. Combining these treatments is recommended as the initial approach to treating patellofemoral pain but further individualized more functional, global treatment is essential.\n                Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of a patellar taping program in the conservative management of patellofemoral pain. Twenty-five patients with patellofemoral pain were randomized into two groups. One group underwent a standard physical therapy program for patellofemoral pain. The other group underwent the same physical therapy program, but use of a patellar taping technique was added to this program. Results of a subjective visual analog scale and changes in isokinetic strength and electromyographic activity of the quadriceps muscle were analyzed. Both the tape and no-tape groups experienced a statistically significant decrease in symptoms (P < 0.05), but no difference in improvement of patellofemoral pain was noted between the groups. Likewise, both groups demonstrated significant improvement in quadriceps muscle isokinetic strength (P < 0.05) and activity (P < 0.001), but no difference in improvement was noted between groups. The results of this study suggest no beneficial effect of adding a patellar taping program to a standard physical therapy program in the conservative treatment of patellofemoral pain. Larger prospective studies are warranted to support this opinion.",
        "target_summary": "The currently available evidence from trials reporting clinically relevant outcomes is low quality and insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of taping, whether used on its own or as part of a treatment programme. Further research involving large, preferably multi-centre, good quality and well reported randomised controlled trials that measure clinically important outcomes and long-term results is warranted. Before this, consensus is required on the diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, the standardisation of outcome measurement and an acceptable approach for patellar taping.",

        "document": "From January 1983 to October 1990, 41 patients with generalised myasthenia gravis were randomly given either prednisone or azathioprine. The main goal was to record the time to the occurrence of the first episode of deterioration. During a mean follow-up of 30 months, 21 patients showed deterioration, 12 in the prednisone group and nine in the azathioprine group (p = 0.40). No difference was observed between the two groups in muscular score and functional grade, assessed at the end of each treatment year, or in tolerance. Treatment failure occurred in 17 patients, 12 in the prednisone group and five in the azathioprine group (p = 0.02); even after adjustment for imbalances in prognostic features, the failure rate remained 2.8 times higher in the prednisone group than in the azathioprine group (p = 0.5). In the patients in whom treatment failed, symptoms were initially more severe than in the others, but the combination of prednisone and azathioprine resulted in clinical improvement, consisting of remission or only minor deficits in half of the patients after two years of treatment. These findings indicate that azathioprine increases treatment response compared with prednisone, although no difference in the duration of improvement was demonstrated. Nevertheless, it appears that the most severe forms of the disease, often resistant to prednisone or azathioprine alone, could benefit from the combination of both drugs. Thirteen patients with moderately severe myasthenia gravis participated in a double-blind study using either 100 mg of prednisone or an equivalen numbder of placebo tablets on alternate days. Anticholinesterase therapy was continued on a demand basis. At the end of 6 months the code was broken. Seven patients were on placebo and three of these had improved to such a degree that steroid therapy was not indicated. Four of these patients ultimately were started on prednisone and improved. Of the six patients on prednisone, three showed no improvement and three were improved. At the end of 2 years, the seven patients still taking prednisone were on maintenance dosage of this drug. Three of this group had experienced relapses when the dosage was cut to 15 to 25 mg on alternate days, and they again improved when the prednisone dosage was increased. No statistical evaluation is possible because of the small number of patients. It can be stated that seven patients improved with steroid therapy. Conversely, not all patients treated with alternate-day prednisone improved. Finally, any evaluation of treatment of myasthenia gravis must take into consideration the potential for spontaneous improvement, as demonstrated by three of the patients treated with placebo. Ten patients with myasthenia gravis were randomized to azathioprine or prednisone as the initial immunomodulating drug and followed for over one year. Of five patients randomized to azathioprine, two had idiosyncratic reactions and were immediately crossed over to prednisone. Two patients completed one year on azathioprine with little or no change in level of function and were crossed over to prednisone and showed greater improvement. The fifth patient on azathioprine had a satisfactory improvement and continued on it during the second year. All patients initially randomized to prednisone improved, but the degree varied among patients. The side effects of azathioprine were idiosyncratic reactions. The side effects of prednisone were manageable. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of one single intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulse therapy in myasthenia gravis.\n                We performed a double blind placebo controlled study (2+2 g IVMP vs placebo) in patients with moderate MG.\n                A mean increase in muscle function of 27 points was found in the treatment group after one IVMP pulse as compared with a 0.7 point increase in the placebo group (P<0.01). In the IVMP group 8 of 10 patients showed a positive treatment response. The mean duration of improvement after IVMP was 8 weeks (range 4-14 weeks). No severe side effects were found. Acetylcholine receptor antibody concentrations were unchanged in spite of the positive treatment response.\n                We conclude that a single IVMP treatment is efficacious and safe in the treatment of moderate MG.",

Efficacy was evaluated using measures of cognition, daily function, and behavior. The primary efficacy measures were the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog/11) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) total score. Secondary outcomes included the Clinician's Interview Based on Impression of Change-Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus), Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and EXIT-25 for assessment of executive functioning. Safety and tolerability were also monitored.\n                Patients treated with galantamine had a greater improvement in ADAS-cog/11 after 26 weeks compared with placebo (-1.8 vs -0.3; p < 0.001). There was no difference between galantamine and placebo at week 26 on the ADCS-ADL score (0.7 vs 1.3; p = 0.783). Improvement in global functioning measured by the CIBIC-plus associated with galantamine approached significance (p = 0.069).

In this study, the subjects were selected by the emergency unit psychiatrist from patients who were admitted to the emergency unit with pseudoseizure. The diagnoses was based on DSM-IV criteria. Paradoxical intention was applied to half of the 30 patients with conversion disorders; the other half were treated with diazepam in order to examine the efficiency of the paradoxical intention versus diazepam. In both groups the differences of the anxiety scores at the beginning of the study were found to be insignificant (z=1.08, p=0.28). Of the 15 patients who completed paradoxical intention treatment, 14 (93.3%) responded favorably to paradoxical intention. On the other hand of 15 patients who completed diazepam therapy, 9 (60%) responded well to therapy and 6 patients carried on their conversion symptoms at the end of 6 weeks. Paradoxical intention-treated patients appeared to have greater improvements in anxiety scores (z=2.43, p<0.015) and conversion symptoms (t=2.27, p=0.034) than the diazepam-treated patients. The results of the present study are encouraging in that paradoxical intention can be effective in the treatment of conversion disorder. This study tested whether a hypnosis-based intervention showed promise as a treatment for patients with conversion disorder, motor type. Forty-four outpatients with conversion disorder, motor type, or somatization disorder with motor conversion symptoms, were randomly assigned to a hypnosis or a waiting-list condition. The hypnosis-condition patients were more improved relative to baseline and the waiting-list controls. Improvement was evident on an observational index of behavioral symptoms associated with the motor conversion and on an interview measure of extent of motor disability. No effect was obtained on a nonspecific measure of broad psychopathology immediately posttreatment. At 6-month follow-up, improvement was maintained across the behavioral and interview measures. The effect size of hypnotizability as a predictor of treatment outcome was comparable to that found for other individual patient differences associated with psychotherapy outcome although non-significant. Hypnotizability scored above patient expectations as a predictor of treatment outcome. The primary aim of this study was threefold: (1) to examine the additional effects of hypnosis aimed at symptom reduction, using symptom-oriented and expression- and insight-oriented techniques in a comprehensive clinical treatment programme for in-patients with a persistent conversion disorder of the motor type; (2) to assess whether the level of hypnotisability was predictive of treatment outcome, and (3) to explore the efficacy of the total clinical treatment programme.\n                The study population consisted of 45 in-patients between 18 and 65 years of age meeting the DSM-III-R criteria for conversion disorder of the motor type or somatisation disorder with motor conversion symptoms. A randomised controlled clinical trial was undertaken. The primary outcome measures were the Video Rating Scale for Motor Conversion Symptoms, the D(isabilities) code items from the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps and the Symptom Checklist-90. Measures of the credibility of treatment and patient expectations of treatment outcome were used as manipulation checks. Hypnotisability was measured using the Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale.\n                Significant treatment results for all outcome measures were found for the total sample. These effects proved to be clinically significant. The use of hypnosis had no additional effect on treatment outcome. Hypnotisability was not predictive of treatment outcome.\n                A comprehensive treatment programme, either with or without hypnosis, can be worthwhile for patients with long-standing conversion symptoms.\n                Copyright 2002 S.

        "document": "A clinical field trial was conducted, over a 2-yr period, to evaluate the efficacy of bi-annual APF gel topical applications without previous prophylaxis in reducing dental caries among high-risk children living in non-fluoridated communities. 488 children 6 yr old, presenting at least three cavities on proximal surfaces of their primary teeth, were randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group received bi-annual topical APF gel applications and the control group received a placebo. All treatments were given at school without any prior toothcleaning. The APF gel provided a 34.3% reduction in caries incidence (P-value = 0.03) among the children with 3-14 cavities on their primary teeth at the beginning of the study. However, the treatment did not show any efficacy in reducing caries incidence among the higher-risk children having initially more than 14 cavities. These findings suggest that the efficacy of APF gel applications without previous prophylaxis varies according to the individual risk of the subjects and that more comprehensive programs should be targeted to very high-risk children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of professional flossing with NaF and SnF2 gels on caries development on approximal tooth surfaces. Two-hundred-and-eighty 13-year-old schoolchildren were divided into 3 groups: (1) NaF (n = 97), (2) SnF2 (n = 85), and (3) placebo gel group (n = 98). The investigation was carried out double-blind. The children were treated 4 times a year for 3 years with 1% NaF gel, 1% SnF2 gel, or placebo gel. The treatment was carried out by dental nurses and the time required per visit was approximately 10 min. After 3 years, the mean approximal caries increment, including initial caries lesions, was 2.8 in the NaF, 2.4 in the SnF2, and 4.0 in the placebo gel group (P< 0.05 for SnF2 vs placebo); a reduction compared to the placebo of 30% and 39% in the NaF and SnF2 groups, respectively. Thus, professional flossing with NaF or SnF2 gel carried out 4 times a year may be considered as an interesting caries-preventing method for large-scale application in schoolchildren. The aim of this study was to assess the caries incidence and plaque accumulation in schoolchildren at caries risk, after brushing the teeth fortnightly with gels containing 0, 0.4% F, 1.25% F as amine fluoride (AmF) or the common amine fluoride toothpaste containing 0.125% F. The study was conducted double blind over an 18-month period, and after 6 months discontinuation of brushing. Only the group that brushed with the 1.25% AmF gel showed a significant decrease in caries development compared to the group that brushed with the 0.125% AmF toothpaste. During the 6-month discontinuation period, the incidence of caries increased in all groups; the differences in caries development between all groups were not significant. Plaque indices were significantly lower in the AmF-treated groups. The highest fluoride concentration in the gel reduced the development of caries to zero, probably due to increased fluoride levels in the oral milieu of caries risk children. In order to maintain a positive effect of fluoride over an extended time period, caries-prone subjects should continue an initiated fluoride programme. This study compared caries inhibition in children by an amine fluoride and an acidulated phosphate fluoride when administered in a topically applied gel. In addition, the effects of applying amine fluoride daily and weekly were compared. Four hundred and sixty-eight children, ages 6 to 13, were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups and received a total of five, 5-minute treatments. The treatment and interval between each of the five treatments were as follows:(A)acidulated phosphate fluoride daily, (B) amine fluoride daily, (C) amine fluoride weekly, (D) placebo daily, and (E) placebo weekly. When the children were examined for total Decayed, Missing, and Filled Surfaces (DMFS) increments 2 years later, no significant differences were observed. However, when the data were examined for effects of DMFS for specific tooth surface, significant restriction (61%) of occlusal increment was shown in the group which was treated with amine fluoride daily for 5 consecutive days as compared with the control group. The anticaries effect of repeated toplications with APF gel was assessed in the primary dentition of 2-6-year-olds after 8, 18 and 28 months. Frequent, but less than daily, topical fluoride therapy appeared to have little effect in pre-school children consuming water-borne fluoride and receiving other traditionally recommended modalities of prevention.",
        "target_summary": "There is clear evidence of a caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride gel. The best estimate of the magnitude of this effect, based on the 14 placebo-controlled trials, is a 21% reduction (95% CI, 14% to 28%) in D(M)FS. This corresponds to an NNT of 2 (95% CI, 1 to 3) to avoid 1 D(M)FS in a population with a caries increment of 2.2 D(M)FS/year, or an NNT of 24 (95% CI, 18 to 36) based on an increment of 0.2 D(M)FS/year.

        "document": "To test the feasibility and the speed of a helmet device to achieve the target temperature of 34 degrees C in unconscious after out of hospital cardiac arrest (CA).\n                Patients with cardiac arrest due to asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA) who remained unconscious after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were enrolled in the study and randomised into two groups: a normothermic group (NG) and a hypothermic group (HG). Bladder and tympanic temperature were monitored every 15 min. A helmet device was used to induce mild hypothermia in the HG. Later on, the effect of mild hypothermia on the haemodynamics, electrolytes, lactate, arterial pH, CaO2, CvO2 and O2 extraction ratio were analysed and compared to the values obtained from the NG.\n                Thirty patients were eligible for the study, 16 were randomised into the HG and 14 were randomised into the NG. The median tympanic temperature at admission in both groups was 35.5 degrees C (range: 33.3-38.5 degrees C) and the median tympanic temperature after haemodynamic stabilisation was 35.7 degrees C (range: 33.6-38.2 degrees C). In the HG, the core and the central target temperature of 34 degrees C were achieved after a median time of 180 and 60 min, respectively after ROSC. At the start of the study, no significant differences between the NG and HG were seen. At the end of the study, lactate concentration and O2 extraction ratio were significantly lower in the HG; however the CvO2 was significantly lower in the NG.\n                Mild hypothermia induced by a helmet device was feasible, easy to perform, inexpensive and effective, with no increase in complications. The study examined the effect of isovolumic high-volume hemofiltration (HF) alone or combined with mild hypothermia (HT) on survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with initial ventricular fibrillation or asystole.\n                Global inflammation in response to whole-body ischemia-reperfusion is common after OHCA and may worsen the overall prognosis.\n                Sixty-one patients admitted between May 2000 and March 2002 in the intensive care units of two hospitals in France were randomized to one of three groups: control, HF (200 ml/kg/h over 8 h) or HF+HT (32 degrees C for 24 h) induced by cooling the HF substitution fluid. Standard supportive care was provided in all three groups. The primary end point was survival with a follow-up time of six months. The effect of HF on death by intractable shock was the secondary end point.\n                The six-month survival curves of the three groups were significantly different, with better survival in the HF group (p = 0.026) and in the HF+HT group (p = 0.018). After adjustment on baseline characteristics of cardiac arrest, HF (with or without HT) was associated with improved survival (logistic regression odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 16.6). Compared to control group, the relative risk of death by intractable shock was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.91) in the HF+HT group and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.85) in the HF group.\n                The HF may improve the overall prognosis after resuscitation from OHCA. Combination of HF with mild HT is feasible and should be evaluated in larger trials. Cardiac arrest outside the hospital is common and has a poor outcome. Studies in laboratory animals suggest that hypothermia induced shortly after the restoration of spontaneous circulation may improve neurologic outcome, but there have been no conclusive studies in humans. In a randomized, controlled trial, we compared the effects of moderate hypothermia and normothermia in patients who remained unconscious after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n                The study subjects were 77 patients who were randomly assigned to treatment with hypothermia (with the core body temperature reduced to 33 degrees C within 2 hours after the return of spontaneous circulation and maintained at that temperature for 12 hours) or normothermia. The primary outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge with sufficiently good neurologic function to be discharged to home or to a rehabilitation facility.\n                The demographic characteristics of the patients were similar in the hypothermia and normothermia groups. Twenty-one of the 43 patients treated with hypothermia (49 percent) survived and had a good outcome--that is, they were discharged home or to a rehabilitation facility--as compared with 9 of the 34 treated with normothermia (26 percent, P=0.046). After adjustment for base-line differences in age and time from collapse to the return of spontaneous circulation, the odds ratio for a good outcome with hypothermia as compared with normothermia was 5.25 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.47 to 18.76; P=0.011). Hypothermia was associated with a lower cardiac index, higher systemic vascular resistance, and hyperglycemia. There was no difference in the frequency of adverse events.\n                Our preliminary observations suggest that treatment with moderate hypothermia appears to improve outcomes in patients with coma after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.",

        "document": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to analyse the ability of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v to prevent further recurrent episodes of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (RCDAD). Recurrence of clinical symptoms (main outcome) was seen in 4 of 11 patients who received metronidazole in combination with L. plantarum 299v and in 6 of 9 treated with metronidazole in combination with placebo. The lactobacilli treatment had no side-effects. Although the small sample size does not allow any conclusion to be drawn concerning the efficacy of L. plantarum in patients with RCDAD, these results may contribute to the ongoing discussion about the benefits of probiotics in patients with RCDAD and encourage the performance of larger multicentre studies. OBJECTIVE--To determine the safety and efficacy of a new combination treatment for patients with Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDD). The treatment combines the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii with an antibiotic (vancomycin hydrochloride or metronidazole). DESIGN--A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group intervention study in patients with active CDD. Patients received standard antibiotics and S boulardii or placebo for 4 weeks, and were followed up for an additional 4 weeks after therapy. Effectiveness was determined by comparing the recurrence of CDD in the two groups using multivariate analysis to control for other risk factors for CDD. SETTING--National referral study of ambulatory or hospitalized patients from three main study coordinating centers. PATIENTS--A total of 124 eligible consenting adult patients, including 64 who were enrolled with an initial episode of CDD, and 60 who had a history of at least one prior CDD episode. Patients who were immunosuppressed due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or cancer chemotherapy within 3 months were not eligible. INTERVENTION--Treatment with oral S boulardii (1 g/d for 4 weeks) or placebo in combination with a standard antibiotic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Recurrence of active CDD. RESULTS--A history of CDD episodes dramatically increased the likelihood of further recurrences. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients treated with S boulardii and standard antibiotics had a significantly lower relative risk (RR) of CDD recurrence (RR, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.97) compared with placebo and standard antibiotics. The efficacy of S boulardii was significant (recurrence rate 34.6%, compared with 64.7% on placebo; P = .04) in patients with recurrent CDD, but not in patients with initial CDD (recurrence rate 19.3% compared with 24.2% on placebo; P = .86). There were no serious adverse reactions associated with S boulardii. CONCLUSIONS--The combination of standard antibiotics and S boulardii was shown to be an effective and safe therapy for these patients with recurrent CDD; no benefit of S boulardii was demonstrated for those with an initial episode of CDD. Recurrent Clostridium difficile disease (CDD) is a difficult clinical problem because antibiotic therapy often does not prevent further recurrences. In a previous study, the biotherapeutic agent Saccharomyces boulardii was used in combination with standard antibiotics and was found to be effective in reducing subsequent recurrences of CDD. In an effort to further refine a standard regimen, we tested patients receiving a regimen of a standard antibiotic for 10 days and then added either S. boulardii (1 g/day for 28 days) or placebo. A significant decrease in recurrences was observed only in patients treated with high-dose vancomycin (2 g/day) and S. boulardii (16.7%), compared with those who received high-dose vancomycin and placebo (50%; P=.05). No serious adverse reactions were observed in these patients. Comparison of data from this trial with data from previous studies indicates that recurrent CDD may respond to a short course of high-dose vancomycin or to longer courses of low-dose vancomycin when either is combined with S. boulardii.",

        "document": "Available therapeutic surfactants are either animal-derived or non-protein-containing synthetic products. Animal-derived surfactants contain variable amounts of surfactant apoproteins, whereas the older-generation synthetic products contain only phospholipids and lack surfactant proteins (SPs). Both decrease morbidity and mortality rates associated with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) among preterm infants, compared with placebo. However, excess mortality rates have been observed with non-protein-containing synthetic surfactants, compared with the animal-derived products. Evidence suggests that synthetic surfactants consisting solely of phospholipids can be improved with the addition of peptides that are functional analogs of SPs. Lucinactant is a new synthetic peptide-containing surfactant that contains sinapultide, a novel, 21-amino acid peptide (leucine and lysine repeating units, KL4 peptide) designed to mimic human SP-B. It is completely devoid of animal-derived components.\n                We hypothesized that the outcomes for premature infants treated with lucinactant and poractant alfa would be similar. Therefore, we compared lucinactant (Surfaxin; Discovery Laboratories, Doylestown, PA) with porcine-derived, poractant alfa (Curosurf; Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy) in a trial to test for noninferiority.\n                A total of 252 infants born between 24 and 28 weeks of completed gestation, with birth weights between 600 and 1250 g, were assigned randomly in a multicenter, multinational, noninferiority, randomized, controlled study to receive either lucinactant (n = 124) or poractant alfa (n = 128) within 30 minutes of life. The primary outcome was the incidence of being alive without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) through 28 days of age. Key secondary outcomes included death at day 28 and 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), air leaks, neuroimaging abnormalities, and other complications related to either prematurity or RDS. An independent, international, data and safety monitoring committee monitored the trial.\n                The treatment difference between lucinactant and poractant alfa for survival without BPD through 28 days was 4.75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -7.3% to 16.8%) in favor of lucinactant, with the lower boundary of the 95% CI for the difference, ie, -7.3%, being greater than the prespecified noninferiority margin of -14.5%. At 28 days, 45 of 119 infants given lucinactant were alive without BPD (37.8%; 95% CI: 29.1-46.5%), compared with 41 of 124 given poractant alfa (33.1%; 95% CI: 24.8-41.3%); at 36 weeks PMA, the rates were 64.7% and 66.9%, respectively. The corresponding mortality rate through day 28 for the lucinactant group was lower than that for the poractant alfa group (11.8% [95% CI: 6.0-17.6%] vs 16.1% [95% CI: 9.7-22.6%]), as was the rate at 36 weeks PMA (16% and 18.5%, respectively). There were no differences in major dosing complications. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the incidences of common complications of prematurity, including intraventricular hemorrhage (grades 3 and 4) and cystic periventricular leukomalacia (lucinactant: 14.3%; poractant alfa: 16.9%).\n                Lucinactant and poractant alfa were similar in terms of efficacy and safety when used for the prevention and treatment of RDS among preterm infants. The ability to enhance the performance of a synthetic surfactant with the addition of a peptide that mimics the action of SP-B, such as sinapultide, brings potential advantages to exogenous surfactant therapy. Evidence suggests that synthetic surfactants consisting solely of phospholipids can be improved through the addition of peptides, such as sinapultide, that mimic the action of human surfactant protein-B (SP-B). A synthetic surfactant containing a mimic of SP-B may also reduce the potential risks associated with the use of animal-derived products. Our objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of a novel synthetic surfactant containing a functional SP-B mimic (lucinactant; Discovery Laboratories, Doylestown, PA) with those of a non-protein-containing synthetic surfactant (colfosceril palmitate; GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, United Kingdom) and a bovine-derived surfactant (beractant; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) in the prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and RDS-related death.\n                We assigned randomly (double-masked) 1294 very preterm infants, weighing 600 to 1250 g and of < or =32 weeks gestational age, to receive colfosceril palmitate (n = 509), lucinactant (n = 527), or beractant (n = 258) within 20 to 30 minutes after birth. Primary outcome measures were the rates of RDS at 24 hours and the rates of death related to RDS during the first 14 days after birth. All-cause mortality rates, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) rates, and rates of other complications of prematurity were prespecified secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes, air leaks, and causes of death were assigned by an independent, masked, adjudication committee with prespecified definitions. The study was monitored by an independent data safety monitoring board.\n                Lucinactant reduced significantly the incidence of RDS at 24 hours, compared with colfosceril (39.1% vs 47.2%; odds ratio [OR]: 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.89). There was no significant difference in comparison with beractant (33.3%). However, lucinactant reduced significantly RDS-related mortality rates by 14 days of life, compared with both colfosceril (4.7% vs 9.4%; OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.25-0.73) and beractant (10.5%; OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.18-0.66). In addition, BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was significantly less common with lucinactant than with colfosceril (40.2% vs 45.0%; OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.56-0.99), and the all-cause mortality rate at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was lower with lucinactant than with beractant (21% vs 26%; OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45-1.00).\n                Lucinactant is a more effective surfactant preparation than colfosceril palmitate for the prevention of RDS. In addition, lucinactant reduces the incidence of BPD, compared with colfosceril palmitate, and decreases RDS-related mortality rates, compared with beractant. Therefore, we conclude that lucinactant, the first of a new class of surfactants containing a functional protein analog of SP-B, is an effective therapeutic option for preterm infants at risk for RDS.",

Subjects were randomised to receive either a short intravenous bolus of salbutamol (15 micro g/kg over 20 minutes) followed by a saline infusion or an aminophylline infusion (5 mg/kg over 20 minutes) followed by 0.9 mg/kg/h.\n                Forty four subjects were enrolled, with 18 randomly allocated to receive salbutamol and 26 to receive aminophylline. The groups were well matched at baseline. An intention to treat analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the asthma severity score (ASS) at 2 hours between the two groups (median (IQR) 6 (6, 8) and 6.5 (5, 8) for salbutamol and aminophylline respectively, p=0.93). A similar improvement in ASS to 2 hours was seen in the two groups (mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -0.97 to 0.80), there was a trend (p=0.07) towards a longer duration of oxygen therapy in the salbutamol group (17.8 hours (95% CI 8.5 to 37.5) v 7.0 hours (95% CI 3.4 to 14.2)), and a significantly (p=0.02) longer length of hospital stay in the salbutamol group (85.4 (95% CI 66.1 to 110.2) hours v 57.3 hours (95% CI 45.6 to 72.0)). There was no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups.\n                This study suggests that, in severe childhood asthma, there is no significant difference in the effectiveness of a bolus of salbutamol and an aminophylline infusion in the first 2 hours of treatment. Overall, the aminophylline infusion was superior as it significantly reduced the length of stay in hospital. In a randomized double-blind trial an intravenous injection of salbutamol (100mug) was compared with an intravenous injection of aminophylline (250mg) in 23 patients with acute exacerbations of asthma. Salbutamol (11 cases) and aminophylline (12) produced a mean proportionate increase in FEV of 26% and 23% respectively. Blood gas pressures showed a trend to improvement with a mean rise in oxygen tension of 2mm Hg(0-2kPa) in the aminophylline group and of 6mm Hg (0-8kPa) in the salbutamol group. Electrocardiogram patterns also showed overall improvement, and mean decreases in pulse rate of 8 beats per minute and 2 beats per minute were noted in the aminophylline and salbutamol groups respectively. Differences in results did not reach conventional levels of significance and no serious side effects were noted. It was concluded that in the doses and routes of administration compared, salbutamol was as effective as aminophylline. A double-blind test to compare IV aminophylline with salbutamol in the treatment of acute, uncontrolled asthma showed that both drugs were equally effective during the first 24 hours. Salbutamol caused a relative tachycardia. Hydrocortisone was given after 2 hours, but did not appear to affect the rate of recovery. Twenty-one patients admitted to hospital with acute severe asthma were allocated in a random, single-blind manner to receive intravenous infusions for 24 hours or either aminophylline or salbutamol or a combination of the two drugs. Infusions were administered by a slow infusion pump with an initial loading dose given over 15 minutes, followed by a continuous lower dose of the drug 24 hours as follows: 1. Aminophylline 0.285 mg/kg/min for 15 min followed by 0.014 mg/kg/min (20 mg/min. followed by 1 mg/min for a 70 kg subject). 2. Salbutamol 0.285 microgram/kg/min for 15 min followed by 0.057 microgram/kg/min (20 microgram/min followed by 4 microgram/min for a 70 kg subject). 3. Combined regimen of the above infusions. In addition each patient received intravenous hydrocortisone (4 g) and potassium chloride (4 g) in 2 litres of 5% dextrose infused over 24 hours amd 35% oxygen given via a Ventimask. Peak expiratory flow rates showed a significant improvement after 15 minutes treatment with aminophylline and the combined infusion, but this was not seen until 60 minutes with the salbutamol infusion. No synergistic bronchodilator effect was seen with the combined infusion. The results show that intravenous aminophylline is superior to intravenous salbutamol in the doses given in the initial treatment of acute asthma and that the combination when given intravenously is not better than aminophylline alone. To compare the efficacy of theophylline, terbutaline, or theophylline combined with terbutaline treatment in critically ill children with status asthmaticus who are already receiving continuous nebulized albuterol and intravenous corticosteroids.\n                Randomized, prospective, controlled, double-blind trial.\n                Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary-care children's medical center.\n                Forty critically ill children between the ages of 3 and 15 yrs with impending respiratory failure secondary to status asthmaticus.\n                All patients received intravenous methylprednisolone and continuous nebulized albuterol. The three study groups received theophylline plus placebo (group 1), terbutaline plus placebo (group 2), or theophylline and terbutaline together (group 3).\n                Differences in baseline characteristics, change in clinical asthma score over time, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay, and incidence of adverse events were determined. The three study groups were similar in age, gender, race, asthma severity, and treatment. There were no differences in clinical asthma score over time, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay, or incidence of adverse events between the three groups, with the exception of a higher incidence of nausea in children in group 3. The median hospital cost of medication and theophylline blood levels was significantly lower in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3 (280 US dollars vs. 3,908 US dollars vs. 4,045 US dollars, respectively, p < .0001).\n                Theophylline, when added to continuous nebulized albuterol therapy and intravenous corticosteroids, is as effective as terbutaline in treating critically ill children with status asthmaticus. The addition of theophylline to baseline therapy is more cost-effective when compared with terbutaline alone or terbutaline and theophylline together. Theophylline should be considered for use early in the management of critically ill asthmatic children.",

Eligible women had a singleton gestation between 20 and 34 weeks, intact membranes, more than three contractions in 30 minutes, and a cervical dilation < or = 1 cm and effacement < 80%.

These patients were randomly assigned to the control group (37 patients) or to the treatment group (41 patients). Patients in the treatment group underwent one neuroreflexotherapeutic intervention. The control group received sham treatment consisting of placement of the same number of epidermal devices within a 5-cm radius of the target zones. Patients from both groups were allowed to continue drug treatment as previously prescribed. The use of medications during the trial was recorded.\n                Patients underwent clinical evaluations on three occasions: within 5 minutes before intervention, within 5 minutes after intervention, and 45 days later. The preintervention assessment was carried out by the physician from each hospital department who included the patient in the study. Each of the two follow-up assessments were carried out independently by two of three physicians who had no connection with the research team. Patients in the treatment group showed immediate lessening of pain compared with the results in patients in the control group. The pain relief was clinically relevant and statistically significant, and it persisted up to the end of the trial.\n                Neuroreflexotherapy intervention seems to be a simple and effective treatment for rapid amelioration of pain episodes in patients with chronic low back pain. At this time, the duration of pain relief beyond 45 days has not been evaluated. Nonspecific low back pain is a very common disorder for which no completely satisfactory treatment has been established. A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was design to assess the efficacy of neuro-reflexotherapic intervention in the treatment of this condition.\n                Ninety-one patients with a confirmed diagnosis of nonspecific low back pain were referred for treatment from primary health care facilities in the Spanish National Health System. A total of 43 patients were assigned to the control group and 48 to the treatment group. Patients in the treatment group received a single neuro-reflexotherapic intervention. Patients in the control group underwent a similar procedure, although inappropriate zones were stimulated. Patients in both groups were allowed to continue drug and physiotherapy treatments prescribed by their general practitioners. According to the design the study was ended when statistically significant and clinically evaluable results were obtained in an analysis carried out half way through the study.\n                Participants underwent clinical evaluations on three occasions: immediately prior to intervention, immediately after and on day 30 afterwards. Patients in the treatment group showed immediate clinically and statistically significant improvements (p < 0.0001) in pain, muscular contracture and mobility, allowing them to discontinue pharmacological treatment and keeping them free of symptoms during the study period.\n                According to results of this study, neuro-reflexotherapic intervention has proved to be an effective method for treating low back pain. A cluster randomized, controlled trial was performed.\n                To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding patients' referral to neuroreflexotherapy intervention to the usual management of subacute and chronic low back pain in routine general practice.\n                Neuroreflexotherapy consists of the temporary implantation of epidermal devices in trigger points in the back and referred tender points in the ear. The efficacy of this procedure for treating subacute and chronic low back pain has been demonstrated in previous randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials.\n                Twenty-one primary care physicians working in seven primary care centers of the Spanish National Health Service in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 11) or the control group (n = 10). The physicians recruited patients who had low back pain that had lasted for 14 or more days despite drug treatment and who did not meet criteria for surgery. The 45 patients recruited by physicians from the control group were treated according to the standard protocol, whereas the 59 patients recruited by physicians from the intervention group were, in addition, referred to neuroreflexotherapy intervention. The analysis of variables was performed taking into account that physicians, not patients, were randomly assigned.\n                Patients underwent clinical evaluations at baseline and 15, 60, and 365 days later. At baseline, median intensity of pain was higher in patients undergoing neuroreflexotherapy than in control patients (visual analogue scale, 6.07; range, 4.67-8.80 vs. 5.15, range 4.11-8.00) and median duration of pain was also higher (48.1, range 28.4-211.1 vs. 17.5, range 15.0-91.5 days). At the last follow-up visit, patients treated with neuroreflexotherapy showed greater improvement than did control patients in low back pain (visual analogue scale, 5.5; range, 3.7-8.8 vs. 1.9; range, -1.2-3.0; P < 0.001); referred pain (visual analogue scale, 3.6; range, 2.7-7.3 vs. 0.6; range, -1.5-2.0; P = 0.001); and disability (Roland-Morris scale, 8.7; range, 2.0-13.3 vs. 2.0; range, -1.5-6.7; P = 0.007). Moreover, neuroreflexotherapy intervention was associated with a significantly (P < 0.035) lower number of consultations to private or public specialists, fewer indications of radiographs by primary care physicians, lower cost of drug treatment, and less duration of sick leave throughout the follow-up period. There were also differences in favor of neuroreflexotherapy intervention in the cost-effectiveness ratio for pain, disability, and quality of life that persisted in the most optimistic, the most conservative, and the average (break-even case) assumptions.\n                Referral to neuroreflexotherapy intervention improves the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the management of nonspecific low back pain.",

Twenty-seven inpatients were placed at bed rest with minimal ambulation, received weekly corticosteroids until 32 weeks of gestation, and underwent ultrasonographic examination at 2-week intervals to assess fetal growth and placental location. Twenty-six outpatients were discharged home after > or = 72 hours of hospitalization. Each week they also received corticosteroids, until 32 weeks' gestation, and ultrasonographic evaluations. Outpatients with recurrent bleeding were readmitted for evaluation. All subjects who reached 36 weeks' gestation with persistent placenta previa underwent amniocentesis. When fetal lung maturity was present, cesarean delivery was electively performed.\n                There were insignificant differences between inpatients and outpatients for mean age, parity, race, type of previa (complete or partial), number of prior vaginal bleeding episodes, and initial hemoglobin value. The mean estimated gestational age at enrollment was 29.1 +/- 3.1 (SD) weeks for inpatients and 29.9 +/- 3.1 weeks for outpatients. In eight patients the placenta was found to no longer cover the internal os by 36 weeks' gestation. There were seven patients in each group who did not complete the protocol for initial treatment assignment. The average estimated gestational age at delivery for the inpatients was 34.5 +/- 2.4 weeks and 34.6 +/- 2.3 weeks for the outpatients (p = 0.90), whereas the mean birth weights were 2413.7 +/- 642.7 gm and 2607.8 +/- 587.1 gm, respectively (p = 0.28). Thirty-three patients (62.3%) had recurrent episodes of bleeding, with 26 requiring expeditious cesarean delivery. Four (14.8%) inpatients and one (3.7%) outpatient required blood transfusion (p = 0.67). There was no difference in neonatal morbidity (defined as the presence of respiratory distress syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, or culture-proved sepsis) between the two groups (relative risk 1.16, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 2.02). There were no neonatal deaths. The mean number of maternal hospital days differed significantly between the two groups: inpatients required an average of 28.6 +/- 20.3 days and outpatients remained hospitalized for an average of 10.1 +/- 8.5 days (p < 0.0001). Cost analysis based on maternal hospital days reveals a net savings of +15,080 per patient if women with symptomatic placenta previa initially diagnosed before 37 weeks' gestation are treated as outpatients.\n                For selected patients, outpatient management of symptomatic placenta previa appears to be an acceptable alternative to traditional conservative expectant inpatient management. Our purpose was to determine whether cervical cerclage reduces the maternal and neonatal morbidity in women with placenta previa.\n                Thirty-nine pregnant women with an initial diagnosis of placenta previa at 24 to 30 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to cervical cerclage (n = 19) or conservative management (n = 20). Subjects were followed up until delivery. Primary outcome measure was gestational age at delivery. Secondary outcome measures were prolongation of pregnancy, number of patients bleeding after being randomly assigned, units of blood transfused, birth weight, hospital stay and costs, and admission to neonatal intensive care unit. Statistical significance was calculated by the Student t test, Fisher's exact probability test, and the chi2 with Yates' correction factor.\n                No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups studied.\n                Cervical cerclage does not appear to be an adequate alternative for the management of placenta previa.",

Eligible participants (n=125) were randomly assigned to either tight or less tight control of mild chronic (essential) or gestational (non-proteinuric) hypertension. The primary outcome measure was the development of severe hypertension during follow-up. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.\n                In the tight target group, adjustment of the dose with an increment of 191 mg yielded a mean dose of methyldopa of 1267+/-406 mg. Both systolic and diastolic BP levels were significantly less than in the tight target group. More women in the less tight group had severe hypertension during follow up (RR 3.167 and 95% CI 1.36-7.37). The rate of antenatal hospitalization was significantly higher in the less tight target group with a relative risk of 2.57 and 95% CI 1.16-5.70. The gestational age at delivery was significantly better in the tight target group. Preterm delivery and birth weight were not significantly different between the study groups.\n                Tight control of blood pressure reduces the rate of antenatal hospitalization and does not adversely affect perinatal outcomes in women with mild essential or gestational hypertension.

Mean dBP was significantly lower with tight control: -3.5 mmHg, 95% credible interval (-6.4, -0.6). Clinician compliance was 79% in both groups. Women were satisfied with their care. With less tight (versus tight) control, the rates of other treatments and outcomes were the following: post-randomisation antenatal antihypertensive medication use: 46 (69.7%) versus 58 (89.2%), severe hypertension: 38 (57.6%) versus 26 (40.0%), proteinuria: 16 (24.2%) versus 20 (30.8%), serious maternal complications: 3 (4.6%) versus 2 (3.1%), preterm birth: 24 (36.4%) versus 26 (40.0%), birthweight: 2675 +/- 858 versus 2501 +/- 855 g, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission: 15 (22.7%) versus 22 (34.4%), and serious perinatal complications: 9 (13.6%) versus 14 (21.5%).\n                The CHIPS pilot trial confirms the feasibility and importance of a large definitive trial to determine the effects of less tight control on serious perinatal and maternal complications.",

It also assesses the relationship between the father's knowledge in these areas and his supportive behaviors toward the adolescent mother and the expected infant. The 28 black 15-18-year-old adolescent males who volunteered to participate in the study were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 15) or a control group (n = 13). Each was pretested (T-1) with Form A of a 75-item prenatal questionnaire, and posttested (T-2) with Form B of the same instrument after an intervention for the experimental group, or 4 weeks after the initial assessment for the comparison group. Findings suggest significant gains in knowledge for the experimental group at T-2 versus T-1 with regard to 1) pregnancy and prenatal care, and 2) infant development and child care. The data also suggest that fathers who were more informed tended to report more supportive behaviors toward the mother and the infant. This study was carried out to evaluate the impact of birth preparation courses on the health of the mother and the newborn. A randomized clinical trial study was carried out on 200 primigravid women younger than age 35 years with gestational age of 20 weeks. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups: control and trial. Birth preparation classes were introduced to the trial group in eight sessions during pregnancy, whereas the control group received only routine care. Measurable clinical, obstetrical, and neonatal advantages were monitored and compared in two groups. Patients in the trial group suffered from back and pelvic pain and headache significantly less often than patients in control group (two-tailed p(2) < 0.05). Preparation is significantly related to reduction in dystocic deliveries and cesarean section ( p(2) = 0.044). Antenatal preparation could play a major role in the health of mother and newborn during labor and postpartum. In addition, antenatal preparation should be introduced to all women during pregnancy as a national health policy in Iran. This project investigated whether augmented prenatal care for high-risk African American women would improve pregnancy outcomes and patients' knowledge of risks, satisfaction with care, and behavior.\n                The women enrolled were African American, were eligible for Medicaid, had scored 10 or higher on a risk assessment scale, were 16 years or older, and had no major medical complications. They were randomly assigned to augmented care (n = 318) or usual care (n = 301). Augmented care included educationally oriented peer groups, additional appointments, extended time with clinicians, and other supports.\n                Women in augmented care rated their care as more helpful, knew more about their risk conditions, and spent more time with their nurse-providers than did women in usual care. More smokers in augmented care quit smoking. Pregnancy outcomes did not differ significantly between the groups; however, among patients in augmented care, rates of preterm births were lower and cesarean deliveries and stays in neonatal intensive care units occurred in smaller proportions. Both groups had lower-than-predicted rates of low birthweight.\n                High-quality prenatal care, emphasizing education, health promotion, and social support, significantly increased women's satisfaction, knowledge of risk conditions, and perceived mastery in their lives, but it did not reduce low birthweight. This quasi-experimental pilot study examined the association of a maternal preparation program with womens' competence in maternal care behaviors, self-perceived adaptation to the maternal role, and satisfaction with the maternal preparation received in conjunction with obstetric and delivery care. Sixteen subjects participated in the program. A cost-benefit questionnaire was completed by the program participants to examine whether the availability of such a maternal preparation program would influence future selections of a hospital for delivery. Our Occupational Therapy Maternal Role Preparation Program was provided to the subjects in four sessions. The program included material on physiological changes in the new mother, orchestration of activities of daily living, infant development and individual differences, and the mother-infant relationship. Results were statistically significant only for the factor of the mothers' satisfaction with their obstetric care and preparation for the maternal role, in favor of the treatment group. In addition, all 8 members of the treatment group reported that they thought the program was helpful and would recommend it to other mothers. Our objective was to assess whether, for women with previous cesarean section, a prenatal education and support program promoting vaginal birth after cesarean delivery increases the probability of vaginal delivery.\n                Women with a single previous cesarean were recruited before 28 weeks' gestation. Women's self-assessed motivation to attempt vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery was measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale: stratum I, low motivation; stratum II, high motivation. Women were randomized by stratum to one of two groups. Those in the \"Verbal\" group participated in an individualized education program. Those in the \"Document\" group were provided with a pamphlet detailing the benefits of planned vaginal birth after cesarean delivery.\n                Rates of vaginal birth after cesarean section were similar in the verbal and document groups: verbal, 339 of 641 (53%); document, 310 of 634 (49%); relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 1.2. There was no evidence of heterogeneity across motivational strata. Regardless of treatment group, women with low motivation for vaginal birth after cesarean section were more than three times as likely to undergo elective repeat cesarean than were women with high motivation (47% vs 13%).\n                There was no evidence that an individualized prenatal education and support program, when offered to all women with previous cesarean delivery, results in a clinically significant increase in the rate of vaginal birth after cesarean section.",

A parallel-group design was used with stratification by sex. Zuclopenthixol acetate (50 to 150 mg) was given intramuscularly every 3 days, whereas liquid haloperidol (10 to 30 mg daily) was given orally three times a day, with supplementary doses of each medication given under double-blind conditions when needed for agitation. No other sedative drugs, including benzodiazepines, were administered. The mean daily dose was 18.9 mg for haloperidol as compared with a mean dose per 3 days of 117.6 mg for zuclopenthixol. The two treatments were found to be equally efficacious on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression Scale. Both drugs induced similar extrapyramidal side effects. However, more tremors were associated with zuclopenthixol as was a tendency for tardive dyskinesia to be unmasked at the end of the injection interval. Sedation was higher with zuclopenthixol acetate than with haloperidol. Serum creatinine phosphokinase levels were not significantly increased after zuclopenthixol injections. The results of this trial suggest that zuclopenthixol acetate given intramuscularly every second to third day offers an alternative to conventional liquid oral haloperidol in the management of acute schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of zuclopenthixol acetate compared with haloperidol in the management of the acutely disturbed schizophrenic patient. Suitable subjects diagnosed as having schizophreniform disorder or acute exacerbation of schizophrenia admitted to the psychiatric wards Hospital Kuala Lumpur were randomised to receive either zuclopenthixol acetate or haloperidol. They were rated blind for three consecutive days using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and UKU Side Effects Scale. Apart from repeat injections of the same medication, no other anti-psychotic was given for the duration of the study. 50 subjects entered the study of which 44 completed. 23 were given zuclopenthixol acetate and 21 haloperidol. Both groups significantly reduced BPRS and CGI scores on all 3 days compared to the initial rating (p < 0.001). There was however no difference between the zuclopenthixol acetate and haloperidol group scores on all days (p > 0.05). More subjects on haloperidol than zuclopenthixol required more than 1 injection during the study. Both groups had minimal side effects. Zuclopenthixol acetate was effective in the management of the acutely disturbed schizophrenic. Zuclopenthixol acetate--a new injectable formulation with a duration of action of 2-3 days--was compared with conventional intramuscular and oral formulations of haloperidol and zuclopenthixol in the initial treatment of acutely disturbed, psychotic patients. The patients were stratified into 3 diagnostic categories: acute psychoses (48 patients), mania (22 patients), and exacerbation of chronic psychoses (73 patients). The patients were rated on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Rating Scale (BRMAS) (only manic patients) and globally on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). The study was an open, randomized multicentre trial with a 6-day treatment period. The zuclopenthixol acetate patients received 1-4 doses, the haloperidol patients 1-26 and the zuclopenthixol patients 1-22 doses. The assessments on the CGI showed that all 3 treatments caused a clear reduction of the severity of illness scores in all 3 diagnostic categories, with no differences between treatments. The ratings of the acute and chronic psychotic patients on the BPRS also showed significant reductions in scores with no differences between treatments. All 3 treatments caused a rapid remission of symptoms on the BRMAS. Haloperidol induced hypokinesia in significantly more patients than zuclopenthixol acetate after 24 h. Later there were no significant differences between treatments. Zuclopenthixol acetate fulfils many desires for an amended neuroleptic formulation for the initial treatment of acutely disturbed psychotic patients. To study the effectiveness, frequency of administration and side effects of zuclopenthixol acetate (ZPTA) and haloperidol (HAL) in the treatment of acute psychotic disturbance with aggression.\n                Purposive sampling method was employed in a group of psychotic patients with aggression admitted to Songkla Neuropsychiatric Hospital, they were randomly divided into 2 groups: ZPTA group and HAL group. All of the patients were evaluated daily for 7 consecutive days using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). Statistical analysis was performed by using the Student t-test and Linear regression.\n                There were 70 patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia, mania and acute psychosis. Thirty-eight patients were randomly assigned to the ZPTA group and were given 50-100 mg of the drug, while 32 patients received HAL 5-10 mg. The result showed a significant reduction in BPRS or CGI scores in both groups. Patients treated with ZPTA required less frequent administration than did those on HAL (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the reduction in scores between the two groups. Nor was there a statistical difference in reduction of aggression based on BPRS rating. Each group of patients showed a few side effects of mild degree.\n                Both ZPTA and HAL were effective in the treatment of acute psychosis with aggression, but frequency of administration was lower in the ZPTA group",
        "target_summary": "Recommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of psychiatric emergencies in preference to 'standard' treatment have to be viewed with caution. Most of the small trials present important methodological flaws and findings are poorly reported. This review did not find any suggestion that zuclopenthixol acetate is more or less effective in controlling aggressive acute psychosis, or in preventing adverse effects than intramuscular haloperidol, and neither seemed to have a rapid onset of action. Use of zuclopenthixol acetate may result in less numerous coercive injections and low doses of the drug may be as effective as higher doses.

Clinical and pathological prognostic factors are used to categorize different groups at risk for disease recurrence and progression. Solitary low-grade (G1, 2A), low-stage (pTa) tumors have less than a 5% risk of progression, while pT1 G3 tumors with concomitant carcinoma in situ (CIS) have a considerably higher risk of progression and metastases. Thus, prospective clinical trials should consider the different risks associated with different prognostic groups and stratify patients accordingly. The Dutch Cooperative Trial evaluated mitomycin versus BCG-Tice versus BCG-RIVM in 469 patients with pTA/pT1 carcinoma and CIS of the urinary bladder after TUR. Of 437 evaluable patients, 50 had CIS, 254 had pTA tumors, and 133 had pT1 tumors. No statistical differences were observed in toxicity between the two strains of BCG, but local and systemic side effects were more frequent in the BCG groups versus the mitomycin group. No differences in response rate were observed between the 3 treatment groups in patients with CIS. A statistically significant difference in favor of mitomycin was seen, however, in patients with papillary tumors. Mitomycin and BCG-RIVM were equally effective, and mitomycin proved significantly more effective than BCG-Tice. No significant difference in efficacy was observed between the two strains of BCG. Disease recurrence during the study in patients with papillary tumors was seen in 43% of mitomycin-treated patients, 64% of the BCG-Tice group, and 46% of patients treated with BCG-Rivm. However, a subgroup analysis for time to first recurrence for pTa versus pT1 and for grade 1 and 2 versus grade 3 papillary tumors showed no statistically significant between-group difference. Further studies comparing identical regimens, doses, and patient groups are needed to define more clearly which patient groups and tumors are more likely to respond to intravesical therapy. Both intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) and bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG; Pasteur strain F) were effective in the present prospective randomized multicenter study consisting of 91 patients with frequently recurrent superficial (Ta-T1) bladder cancer. The result was in favour of BCG, as shown by the measurements with complete response (CR), disease-free interval and recurrence rate. CR of 58% with MMC and 40% with BCG were reached in 22 instillation series on carcinoma in situ of 18 patients. Due to side effects, MMC instillations were discontinued in 8.6%, and BCG instillations in 19.6%, respectively.

Efficacy was evaluated with psychophysical tests and measurements of glucose balance, serum lipids, aminoterminalpropeptide (PIIINP) concentration, and body weight.\n                Ginseng therapy elevated mood, improved psychophysical performance, and reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) and body weight. The 200-mg dose of ginseng improved glycated hemoglobin, serum PIIINP, and physical activity.

These patients were divided in two groups at random: group A underwent continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with micropump CPI 9100 Lilly; group B underwent intensified insulin therapy with three daily doses of MC rapid insulin, two of which associated with MC intermediate insulin. All the patients were able to monitor their own blood glucose levels at home by means of reactive strips and reflectometer. In both the groups the mean glycemic values during fast and two hours after meals, and the eventual presence of urinary keton bodies and hypoglycemic crisis were evaluated during the course of pregnancy: these parameters turned out to be identical in the two groups. The increased need of insulin, the maternal body weight gain, the week and mode of delivery, the neonatal weight and the maternal and fetal complications also turned out to be identical in the two groups. To conclude, a good maternal metabolic control can be obtained either with the intensified conventional insulin therapy of with micropumps, if the patients, being properly instructed, are responsible for the monitoring of their own blood glucose levels at home. Two groups of pregnant diabetic women, fifteen with type I and fourteen with type II diabetes, were randomly assigned either to CSII or to ICT and the subgroups compared with respect to glycaemic control, insulin requirement and perinatal out-come. Ten non-diabetic pregnant women served as controls for the variations in the metabolic parameters considered (24-hour mean blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin). Strict glycaemic control was achieved and maintained by both regimens before week 13 in all patients with type I and in 57.1% of patients with type II diabetes. The mean insulin requirements in the type I group increased up to week 34-36 and then stabilized to term in patients receiving CSII and rose progressively to term in those receiving ICT. In the type II group insulin requirements rose up to week 36 in patients receiving CSII and up to week 32 in those receiving ICT, stabilizing thereafter on both regimens. No significant differences in mean insulin requirement at the different stages of gestation were found between the patients receiving CSII and those receiving ICT of either group. Perinatal outcome was satisfactory in both groups, although control of foetal growth was better with ICT than with CSII.

The results suggest that the Keys to Caregiving program shows promise as a method of improving adolescent mothers' interactions with their infants. The effects of videotape instruction and feedback (videotherapy) on mothering behaviors were evaluated in this longitudinal study. In this study, 31 adolescents and their healthy infants were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. All subjects were videotaped during structured mother-infant teaching episodes in their homes at 1 and 2 months postpartum. Experimental group subjects reviewed the videotaped 1-month teaching episode and received feedback from a specially trained professional nurse who emphasized positive aspects of maternal behavior. Instruction was individualized according to the mother's needs. Results of a repeated measures MONOVA revealed significant differences in the pattern of change over time between subjects in the experimental and control groups on a measure of actual maternal behaviors. Adolescents receiving videotape instruction and feedback obtained significantly higher maternal behavior scores at 1 and 2 months postpartum. To use social learning theory to develop and examine the effectiveness of a 15-minute, culturally sensitive videotape in altering mealtime communication and attitudes among African-American adolescent mothers.\n                Randomized clinical trial with baseline and follow-up evaluations.\n                High schools, WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) Clinics, and Family Support Centers serving low-income families.\n                Fifty-nine first-time, African-American adolescent mothers of infants.\n                Intervention group viewed and received a copy of a videotape titled \"Feeding Your Baby With Love.\" The messages, title, music, and setting were designed by an advisory group of six African-American adolescent mothers who were filmed feeding their infants in their homes.\n                During baseline and follow-up evaluations, mothers were videotaped feeding their baby and completed a questionnaire on attitudes toward mealtime behavior. Analysis of covariance with repeated measures indicated changes in both behavior and attitudes. At follow-up, intervention mothers were more involved with their infant and reported more favorable attitudes toward feeding and communication than control mothers.\n                Brief culturally sensitive videotapes may be effective strategies to promote parenting skills and to prevent social and health problems among adolescents.",
        "target_summary": "Variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached.

        "document": "The aim of this study was to compare the results of the humerus intramedullary nail (IMN) and dynamic compression plate (DCP) for the management of diaphyseal fractures of the humerus. Forty-seven patients with diaphyseal fracture of the shaft of the humerus were randomised prospectively and treated by open reduction and internal fixation with IMN or DCP. The criteria for inclusion were grade 1 or 2a compound fractures, polytrauma, early failure of conservative treatment and unstable fractures. The patients with pathological fractures, grade 3 open fractures, refractures and old neglected fractures of the humerus were excluded from the study. Twenty-three patients underwent internal fixation by IMN and 24 by DCP. Reamed antegrade nailing was done in all cases. DCP was done through an anterolateral or posterior approach. The outcome was assessed in terms of the union time, union rate, functional outcome and the incidence of complications. Functional outcome was assessed using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons' Score (ASES). On comparing the results by independent samples t test, there was no significant difference in ASES scores between the two groups (P>0.05). The average union time was found to be significantly lower for IMN as compared to DCP (P<0.05). The union rate was found to be similar in both groups. Complications such as infection were found to be higher with DCP as compared to IMN, while shortening of the arm (1.5-4 cm) and restriction of shoulder movements due to impingement by the nail were found to be higher with IMN as compared to DCP. However, this improved in all patients following the removal of the nail once the fracture had healed. This study proves that IMN can be considered a better surgical option for the management of diaphyseal fractures of the humerus as it offers a short union time and lower incidence of serious complications like infection. However, there appears to be no difference between the two groups in terms of the rate of union and functional outcome. To compare the clinical and radiographic results for locked intramedullary (IM) nails and plates used in the treatment of humeral diaphyseal fractures.\n                Prospective randomization by sealed-envelope technique of eighty-four patients into two study groups: those treated by intramedullary nailing (IMN group; n = 38) and those treated by compression plating (PLT group; n = 46).\n                Patients admitted consecutively to a university-affiliated Level I trauma center. PATIENT/PARTICIPANTS: All skeletally mature patients admitted to Harborview Medical Center with acute humeral shaft fractures requiring surgical stabilization. Fractures of the diaphysis were defined as being at least three centimeters distal to the surgical neck and at least five centimeters proximal to the olecranon fossa.\n                Treatment with locking antegrade intramedullary humeral nails (Russell-Taylor design [Smith and Nephew Richards]) or with 4.5-millimeter dynamic compression and limited contact dynamic compression plates (AO design [Synthes]).\n                Clinical outcome measurements included fracture healing, radial nerve recovery, infection, and elbow and shoulder discomfort. Radiographic measurements included fracture alignment, time to healing, delayed union, and nonunion.\n                Follow-up averaged thirteen months. Forty-two fractures (93 percent) in the PLT group were healed by sixteen weeks versus thirty-three fractures (87 percent) in the IMN group (p = 0.70). Shoulder pain and a decrement in shoulder range of motion (ROM) were significant associations with IMN (p = 0.007 for both variables) but not with PLT. A decrement in elbow ROM was significantly associated with PLT (p = 0.03), especially for fractures of the distal third of the diaphysis, whereas elbow pain was not (p = 0.123). The sum of other complications demonstrated nearly equal prevalence for both treatment groups.\n                For patients requiring surgical treatment of a humeral shaft fracture, intramedullary nailing and compression plating both provide predictable methods for achieving fracture stabilization and ultimate healing. We randomised prospectively 44 patients with fractures of the shaft of the humerus to open reduction and internal fixation by either an intramedullary nail (IMN) or a dynamic compression plate (DCP). Patients were followed up for a minimum of six months. There were no significant differences in the function of the shoulder and elbow, as determined by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons' score, the visual analogue pain score, range of movement, or the time taken to return to normal activity. There was a single case of shoulder impingement in the DCP group and six in the IMN group. Of these six, five occurred after antegrade insertion of an IMN. In the DCP group three patients developed complications, compared with 13 in the IMN group. We had to perform secondary surgery on seven patients in the IMN group, but on only one in the DCP group (p = 0.016). Our findings suggest that open reduction and internal fixation with a DCP remains the best treatment for unstable fractures of the shaft of the humerus. Fixation by IMN may be indicated for specific situations, but is technically more demanding and has a higher rate of complications. The results of open reduction and internal fixation of humeral shaft fractures by either an intramedullary nail or a dynamic compression plate were compared.\n                The study included 60 patients (43 males, 17 females; mean age 38 years; range 19 to 61 years) with humerus fractures. Thirty-three patients were treated with intramedullary nails and 27 patients with dynamic compression plates. Functional results were evaluated according to the Stewart and Hundley's criteria. The two methods were compared. The mean follow-up period was 42 months (range 28 to 72 months).\n                Healing times did not differ between the two treatment groups (p>0.05). Radial nerve palsy occurred only in the dynamic compression plate group, with four patients being affected. On the other hand, the rate of non-union was significantly higher in patients treated with intramedullary nailing (p<0.05).\n                No ideal fixation technique exists in the treatment of humerus fractures. Despite higher non-union rates, intramedullary nailing may be the method of choice in the treatment of humerus fractures because of such advantages as low morbidity, small dissection of soft tissues, and greater ease of application.",
        "target_summary": "The available evidence shows that intramedullary nailing is associated with an increased risk of shoulder impingement, with a related increase in restriction of shoulder movement and need for removal of metalwork. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there were any other important differences, including in functional outcome, between dynamic compression plating and locked intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fractures.",

The patients were treated, at the time of the admission to the hospital, with penicillin (20 mega-units daily) or a placebo. A total of 52 patients was studied, 26 in each treatment group. Meningitis developed in one patient in the placebo group. Staphylococcus epidermidis (sensitive to penicillin) was the causative pathogen in this patient who also had a retained intraventricular foreign body. The frequency of extra-neurological infections and of asymptomatic pulmonary bacterial colonization was similar in both groups, but frequency of asymptomatic bacteriuria was higher in the placebo-treated patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the controversial issue of the use of prophylactic antibiotics in open and basilar fractures of the skull. A series of 157 patients were randomized to receive no antibiotics (group A = 46 patients) or ceftriaxone for 3 days (group B = 50 patients), or the combination ampicillin/sulphadiazine for 3 days (group C = 61 patients). The incidence of meningitis was similar in both the antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups. However, the overall incidence of infectious complications in the non-antibiotic group was significantly higher than in the antibiotic group (8.7 per cent vs 0.9 per cent, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the ceftriaxone group and the ampicillin/sulphadiazine group. The results of the study suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis has a role in the management of open and basilar fractures. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of the prophylactic use of ceftriaxone for the prevention of meningitis in patients with acute traumatic pneumocephalus.\n                In this prospective, single-institution, randomized clinical trial, 109 patients with mild head injury and traumatic pneumocephalus were randomly assigned to receive or not receive an antibiotic medication (ceftriaxone, 1 g given twice a day) until occurrence of meningitis or at least 5 days after trauma. The patients were followed up for 1 month posttrauma. The 109 patients were divided into two groups: 53 were assigned to the prophylactic antibiotics therapy group and 56 to the control group. The overall rate of meningitis was 20.1% and the rates of meningitis in the two groups were not significantly different. The results were the same when adjusted for the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score, sex, and age, as well as for an intradural location of air, air volume, presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea or CSF otorrhea, radiological sign of a skull base fracture, or intracranial hemorrhage.\n                The results of this study do not substantiate the efficacy of ceftriaxone used in the prevention of meningitis in patients with traumatic pneumocephalus after mild head injury or in any specific subgroup of these patients. Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and intracranial hemorrhage may be considered primary risk factors for the development of meningitis in patients with posttraumatic pneumocephalus and, in the absence of these symptoms, intradural location of air and air volume greater than 10 ml may be considered secondary risk factors. Further studies in this area are warranted. The efficacy of chemoprophylaxis in the treatment of basilar skull fractures was studied in 129 patients over a 2-year period; antibiotics were found ineffective in preventing central nervous system infections, and in some cases may have proved harmful. It is suggested that a more rational approach to the treatment of basilar skull fractures includes close observation of the patient for early signs of meningitis, and if these should develop, treatment with antibiotics appropriate to the organism involved.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the postoperative changes of proximal and distal segments after IVRO and SSRO with semirigid internal fixation.\n                Thirty Japanese adults with a diagnosis of prognathic mandible were randomized to undergo either IVRO (n = 15) or SSRO (n = 15) according to an adaptive random assignment procedure. The postoperative changes of the proximal and distal segments were assessed with posteroanterior and lateral cephalograms.\n                Compared with the SSRO group, the B-point and pogonion moved significantly posteriorly and inferiorly in the IVRO group from 1 month to 3 months after surgery. At 1 year after surgery, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the horizontal and vertical stability of the B-point and the pogonion. In the IVRO group, the gonion deviated significantly laterally from 1 week until 1 month after surgery as compared with that of the SSRO group. There was a significant correlation between the amount of setback and the amount of lateral gonial deviation in the IVRO group from 1 week to 1 year after surgery.\n                Although in IVRO cases, distal segments moved posteriorly and inferiorly immediately after the release of maxillomandibular fixation, the stability after IVRO is equal to that after SSRO with semirigid internal fixation. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the importance of ramal osteosynthesis and evaluate postoperative condylar movements. The right temporomandibular joints of 53 patients with mandibular prognathism were examined by linear tomography the day before, 1 week after, and 1 year after surgery. During surgery the patients were randomly allocated to two groups: one with (n = 26) and one without (n = 27) osteosynthesis. It was found that osteosynthesis did not influence condyle position (p greater than 0.3). The two groups were thereafter pooled. Radiographic measurements of the posterior and anterior interarticular space revealed that condyle position 1 week postoperatively was forward and downward in relation to the preoperative position (posterior fossa, p less than 0.001; anterior fossa, p less than 0.01). One year later the condyle position demonstrated a tendency to approximate the preoperative position, especially with respect to the posterior part, but there was still a significant (p less than 0.01) difference when related to the original position. In conclusion, osteosynthesis after ramus osteotomy seems to be of no importance when healing and postoperative condyle position are considered. Furthermore, 1 year after surgery the condyles were not reestablished in their preoperative positions.",

The patients were distributed randomly into two groups: a) group A, local infiltration via a posterior approach with a depot corticosteroid and local anesthesia, and b) group B, treated for 3 days with a 5-mg NTC patch.\n                Age, sex, pain (measured with an analog visual scale) and adverse events. In patients who showed a partial response, treatment was repeated up to 3 times at 15-day intervals. Pain was tested after 7-10 days of treatment. Complete improvement was considered a reduction in pain of more than 5 points on the analog visual scale; partial improvement was considered a reduction of 3-5 points, and treatment failure was recorded when there was no improvement in pain or when there was a decrease of less than 3 points.\n                A total of 48 patients were included; 33 (69%) were women and 15 (31%) were men. Mean age was 61 years. In group A, complete improvement was seen in 19 patients and partial improvement in 3; treatment failed in 2 patients. In group B complete improvement was seen in 5 patients, partial improvement in 5, and failure of treatment in 14. The difference between groups was statistically significant. Adverse events were mild pain at the injection site in 4 patients from group A, and headache in 15 patients from group B, 8 of whom abandoned treatment for this reason.\n                Treatment with NTG is not a clear alternative to infiltration of corticosteroids in patients with RCT, because of its lack of effectiveness and because of the greater number of patients who had adverse events that lead them to abandon treatment. We have conducted a prospective double blind randomized and placebo controlled clinical study in 20 patients with shoulder pain syndrome caused by supraspinatus tendinitis to determine whether transdermal nitroglycerin (NTG) has analgesic action in this condition. In a randomized manner we used a 5-mg NTG (Nitroplast) patch per day over 3 days or similar placebo patches applied in the most painful area. Patients were evaluated before treatment was initiated and after 24 and 48 h. The assessment was made blindly by the same clinical investigator. The follow-up showed a significant decrease in intensity of pain at 24 h (7.05 +/- 0.4 to 4.5 +/- 0.5) and 48 h (2 +/- 0.3) in the NTG group (P < 0.003). No changes were observed in the placebo group. The mean pain duration, activity of the extremity and hours of sleep also improved in the NTG group, with no significant modification in the placebo group. Two patients experienced headache as a side effect 24 h after treatment was started. Patients in the NTG group remained free of symptoms when they were assessed 15 days later. We conclude that NTG is useful in the treatment of shoulder pain syndrome caused by supraspinatus tendinitis and that this treatment could be a useful approach to the management of this common disturbance and probably also in other tendon musculoskeletal disorders. Topical glyceryl trinitrate therapy has previously demonstrated short-term pain reduction in patients with supraspinatus tendinopathy.\n                Topical glyceryl trinitrate improves outcome measures in patients with supraspinatus tendinopathy.\n                Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1.\n                Fifty-three patients (57 shoulders) were recruited, and the authors completed a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of continuous topical glyceryl trinitrate treatment (1.25 mg/24-h glyceryl trinitrate).\n                The glyceryl trinitrate group had significantly reduced shoulder pain with activity, at night, and at rest at week 24 (P = .03); reduced internal rotation impingement at week 24 (P = .02); increased range of motion in abduction and internal rotation at week 24 (P = .04); and increased force at weeks 12 and 24 with supraspinatus muscle testing (P = .001), external rotation (P = .04), internal rotation (P = .01), adduction (P = .04), and subscapularis pushoff (P = .01). Forty-six percent of patients on glyceryl trinitrate patches were asymptomatic with activities of daily living at 6 months compared with 24% of patients with tendon rehabilitation alone (P = .007, chi(2) analysis). Mean effect size for all outcome measures was 0.26.\n                Topical glyceryl trinitrate treatment significantly improved pain scores, range of motion, internal rotation impingement, muscular force, and patient outcomes in patients with supraspinatus tendinopathy.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Surgeons have been reluctant to apply laparoscopic techniques to Crohn's disease surgery because of concerns with evaluating and excising inflamed tissue using laparoscopic methods. Additionally in Crohn's disease surgery, laparoscopic techniques have not been demonstrated to have clear advantages over conventional ones.\n                We conducted a prospective, randomized trial in one surgical department comparing laparoscopic vs. conventional techniques in 60 patients (25 males), median age 34.4 (range, 10-60.1) years, undergoing elective ileocolic resection for refractory Crohn's disease. Postoperatively, all patients underwent measurement of pulmonary function tests every 12 hours, and were treated identically on a highly controlled protocol with regard to analgesic administration, feeding, and postoperative care.\n                Of the 31 patients assigned to laparoscopic and 29 to the conventional group, all had isolated Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum plus or minus the cecum. Median length of the incision was 5 cm in the laparoscopic group and 12 cm in the conventional group. Overall recovery of 80 percent of forced expiratory volume (one second) and forced vital capacity was a median of 2.5 days for laparoscopic and 3.5 days for conventional (P = 0.03). There was no difference in the amount of morphine equivalents used between groups postoperatively. Flatus and first bowel movement returned a median of 3 and 4 days, respectively, after laparoscopic vs. 3.3 and 4 days, respectively, after conventional surgery (P = 0.21). Median length of stay was five (range, 4-30) days for laparoscopic, and six (range, 4-18) days for conventional surgery. Major complications occurred in one patient in each group. Minor complications occurred in four laparoscopic and eight conventional patients (P < 0.05). There were no deaths. Two laparoscopic patients were converted to conventional as a result of adhesions or inflammation. All patients recovered well and there were no clinical recurrences in the follow-up period (median, 20; range, 12-45 months).\n                Within a single institution, single surgical team, prospective, randomized trial, laparoscopic techniques offered a faster recovery of pulmonary function, fewer complications, and shorter length of stay compared with conventional surgery for selected patients undergoing ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease. The aim of the study was to compare laparoscopic-assisted and open ileocolic resection for primary Crohn's disease in a randomized controlled trial.\n                Sixty patients were randomized for laparoscopic-assisted or open surgery. Primary outcome parameter was postoperative quality of life (QoL) during 3 months of follow-up, measured by SF-36 and GIQLI questionnaire. Secondary parameters were operating time, morbidity, hospital stay, postoperative morphine requirement, pain, and costs.\n                Patient characteristics were not different. Conversion rate was 10% (n=3). Median operating time was longer in laparoscopic compared with open surgery (115 versus 90 minutes; P<0.003). Hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group (5 versus 7 days; P=0.008). The number of patients with postoperative morbidity within the first 30 days differed between the laparoscopic and open group (10% versus 33%; P=0.028). There was no statistically significant difference in QoL between the groups during follow-up. Significant time effects were found on all scales of the SF-36 (P<0.001) and the GIQLI score (P<0.001). QoL declined in the first week, returned to baseline levels after 2 weeks, and was improved 4 weeks and 3 months after surgery. Median overall costs during the 3 months follow-up were significantly different: euro6412 for laparoscopic and euro8196 for open surgery (P=0.042).\n                Although QoL measured by SF-36 and GIQLI questionnaires was not different for laparoscopic-assisted compared with the open ileocolic resection, morbidity, hospital stay, and costs were significantly lower. The purpose of this study was to analyze long-term recurrence rates and complications in patients previously enrolled in a prospective randomized trial comparing laparoscopic (LC) and open ileocolectomy (OC) for ileocolic Crohn's disease (CD).\n                Follow-up data were available on 56 of 60 patients. Demographic data, recurrence rates, need for additional surgery related to primary procedure, and medication use were recorded.\n                Mean follow-up for 56 patients (27 LC vs 29 OC) was 10.5 years and comparable between LC and OC (10.0 vs 11.0, respectively; P = .64). One patient died 8 years after OC of causes unrelated to CD. Eight patients for each group underwent initial reoperative (26% LC vs 28% OC; P = .89). One patient underwent incisional hernia repair after LC (4%) versus 4 patients (14%) after OC (P = .61). Two patients in the LC group underwent adhesiolysis versus none after OC (P = .23). Incidences of anorectal disease, anorectal surgery, endoscopic or radiologic recurrence, and medication use were also similar between LC and OC. OC patients requiring operation during follow-up were significantly more likely than LC to require multiple operations (P = .006).\n                Long-term data from this prospective randomized trial confirm that LC is at least comparable to OC in the treatment of ileocolic CD.",

PHT, however, has many undesirable side effects (SEs) and drug interactions with glioma chemotherapy. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a newer antiepileptic drug (AED) with fewer SEs and essentially no drug interactions. We performed a pilot study testing the safety and feasibility of switching patients from PHT to LEV monotherapy for postoperative control of glioma-related seizures. Over a 13-month period, 29 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to initiate LEV therapy within 24 h of surgery or to continue PHT therapy. 6 month follow-up data were available for 15 patients taking LEV and for 8 patients taking PHT. In the LEV group, 13 patients (87%) were seizure-free. In the PHT group, 6 patients (75%) were seizure-free. Reported SEs at 6 months was as follows (%LEV/%PHT group): dizziness (0/14), difficulty with coordination (0/29), depression (7/14) lack of energy or strength (20/43), insomnia (40/43), mood instability (7/0). The pilot data presented here suggest that it is safe to switch patients from PHT to LEV monotherapy following craniotomy for supratentorial glioma.

Each treatment consisted of eight needles applied to bilateral points LI4, SP6, UB31, and UB32. The primary outcome was time elapsed from the time of randomization to delivery. Secondary outcomes included rates of cesarean section and induction of labor. Medical records were abstracted for maternal demographic, medical, and delivery outcome data. A priori sample size calculation revealed that 56 women were required to detect a 72-hour difference in delivery time with a power of 83% and an alpha of 0.05. Student's t-test, Chi-square, and Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to compare groups.\n                Fifty-six women were randomized and completed the study procedures. Race, age, gestational age, and cervical Bishop score were similar in both groups. Mean time to delivery occurred 21 hours sooner in the acupuncture group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.36). Compared to controls, women in the acupuncture group tended to be more likely to labor spontaneously (70% vs. 50%, p = 0.12) and less likely to deliver by cesarean section (39% vs. 17%, p = 0.07). Of women who were not induced, those in the acupuncture group were more likely to be delivered than the controls at any point after enrollment (p = 0.05).\n                Acupuncture is well tolerated among term nulliparous women and holds promise in reducing interventions that occur in post-term pregnancies. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether acupuncture at term can influence cervical ripening, induce labor and thus reduce the need for postdates induction.\n                On the estimated date of confinement (EDC) women were prospectively randomized to an acupuncture group (AG) or a control group (CG). Data of 45 women were evaluated (AG, n = 25; CG, n = 20). Inclusion criteria were as follows: confirmed EDC, uncomplicated course of pregnancy, singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation. Exclusion criteria were as follows: cervical dilation > 3 cm, active labor, premature rupture of membranes, previous cesarean section, pathologies in mother or fetus. Women were examined at 2-day intervals. The cervical length was measured with vaginal ultrasonography, cervical mucus was obtained for a fetal Fibronectin test and the cervical status was assessed according to the Bishop score. In the AG, the points Hegu (Large Intestine 4) and Sanyinjiao (Spleen 6) were pierced on both sides every second day. If women were not delivered 10 days after EDC, labor was induced by administering vaginal prostaglandin tablets.\n                The cervical length in the AG was shorter than that in the CG on day 6 and day 8 after EDC (P = 0.04 for both). In the AG the time period from the first positive Fibronectin test to delivery was 2.3 days, while that in the CG was 4.2 days (P = 0.08). The time period from EDC to delivery was on average 5.0 days in the AG and 7.9 days in the CG (P = 0.03). Labor was induced in 20% of women in the AG (n = 5) and in 35% in the CG (n = 7) (P = 0.3). Overall duration of labor, and first and second stage of labor were not different in the two groups. In 56% of women who underwent acupuncture (n = 14) and in 65% of controls (n = 13), Oxytocin was used to augment labor. (P = 0.54).\n                Acupuncture at points LI4 and SP 6 supports cervical ripening at term and can shorten the time interval between the EDC and the actual time of delivery. The objective was to investigate whether acupuncture could be a reasonable option for augmentation in labor after spontaneous rupture of membranes at term and to look for possible effects on the progress of labor.\n                In a randomized controlled trial 100 healthy parturients, with spontaneous rupture of membranes at term, were assigned to receive either acupuncture or no acupuncture. The main response variables were the duration of active labor, the amount of oxytocin given, and number of inductions.\n                Duration of labor was significantly reduced (mean difference 1.7 h, p=0.03) and there was significant reduction in the need for oxytocin infusion to augment labor in the study group compared to the control group (odds ratio 2.0, p=0.018). We also discovered that the participants in the acupuncture group who needed labor induction had a significantly shorter duration of active phase than the ones induced in the control group (mean difference 3.6 h, p=0.002). These findings remained significant also when multiple regression was performed, controlling for potentially confounding factors like parity, epidural analgesia, and birth weight.\n                Acupuncture may be a good alternative or complement to pharmacological methods in the effort to facilitate birth and provide normal delivery for women with prelabor rupture of membranes.",

These children had been immunized once or twice in early childhood with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and were reimmunized at the time of randomization.\n                Serotype-specific IgG antibody responses to reimmunization varied according to pneumococcal serotype but in general were mediocre or poor; the poorest response was to serotype 6B. The antibody responses were similar in subjects with continued penicillin prophylaxis or placebo treatment, and in subjects who received one or two pneumococcal vaccinations before reimmunization. The occurrence of pneumococcal bacteremia was associated with low IgG antibody concentrations to the infecting serotype.\n                Reimmunization of children with sickle cell anemia who received pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at age 5 years induces limited production of serotype-specific IgG antibodies, regardless of previous pneumococcal vaccine history. Continued penicillin prophylaxis does not interfere with serotype-specific IgG antibody responses to reimmunization. Children with sickle cell anemia have an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, especially to those caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. We therefore conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test whether the regular, daily administration of oral penicillin would reduce the incidence of documented septicemia due to S.pneumoniae in children with sickle cell anemia who were under the age of three years at the time of entry. The children were randomly assigned to receive either 125 mg of penicillin V potassium (105 children) or placebo (110 children) twice daily. The trial was terminated 8 months early, after an average of 15 months of follow-up, when an 84 percent reduction in the incidence of infection was observed in the group treated with penicillin, as compared with the group given placebo (13 of 110 patients vs. 2 of 105; P = 0.0025), with no deaths from pneumococcal septicemia occurring in the penicillin group but three deaths from the infection occurring in the placebo group. On the basis of these results, we conclude that children should be screened in the neonatal period for sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and that those with sickle cell anemia should receive prophylactic therapy with oral penicillin by four months of age to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with pneumococcal septicemia. The efficacy of prophylactic penicillin and of 14 valent pneumococcal vaccine in preventing pneumococcal infection in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease was investigated in 242 children aged 6 months to 3 years at entry. In the first five years of the trial there were 11 pneumococcal infections in the pneumococcal vaccine treated group, 10 by serotypes present in the vaccine. Type 23 accounted for five of these, and there was evidence of higher infection rates in those given the vaccine before age 1. No pneumococcal isolations occurred in the penicillin group while receiving penicillin, although four isolations occurred within one year of stopping penicillin. Probably the most effective prophylaxis against pneumococcal infection requires penicillin beyond the age of 3. The age at which pneumococcal vaccine should be given must await further data on antibody response and clinical efficacy in these patients.",

The experimental group was given a series of training sessions in biofeedback and used biofeedback equipment during labor. All subjects were monitored during the labor and delivery period for their reports of pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a verbal descriptor scale (VDS). Results showed that women using biofeedback during childbirth reported significantly lower pain: from admission to labor and delivery (p less than 0.05:VDS; p less than 0.01:VAS), at delivery (p less than 0.005:VDS), and 24-hr postpartum (p less than 0.01:VDS).

        "document": "Thirty-five healthy patients aged 15-36 years scheduled for bilateral tonsillectomy were randomly allocated to receive the following treatments: tonsillar infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine 5 min before surgical incision (n = 12); identical tonsillar infiltration administered after both tonsils had been surgically removed (n = 12); infiltration with isotonic saline 5 min before the operation (n = 11). There were no significant differences between groups in pain scores (VAS) at rest or during drinking of 100 ml of water as measured at 4 h postoperatively or on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 8th postoperative days. Four, five and three patients in the pre-operative bupivacaine, postoperative bupivacaine, and saline groups, respectively, received one dose of 0.1 mg.kg-1 morphine intravenously (p = 0.76). Cumulative acetylsalicylic acid requirements during the observation period were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.78). These results suggest that pre-operative infiltration of 0.25% bupivacaine has no beneficial pre-emptive analgesic action compared to both an identical treatment administered after tonsillectomy and a placebo. Early postoperative pain following tonsillectomy remains a significant obstacle to speedy recovery and smooth convalescence. Inadequate analgesia causes poor oral intake and occasionally requires overnight hospitalization in same-day surgery practices. Although several otolaryngologists anecdotally support intraoperative infiltration with long-acting anesthetic agents for postoperative pain control, to our knowledge, no previous study confirms this claim. In a prior investigation, we found no difference between bupivacaine hydrochloride and saline placebo in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy. In this trial, we performed a similar study in an adult population. Fifty-one patients undergoing tonsillectomy with local anesthesia were randomized into bupivacaine or saline placebo groups. Patients provided the following data: (1) pain level; (2) oral intake; (3) number of pain medication doses; and (4) level of pain on jaw opening, all at 10 hours postoperatively. Bupivacaine administration resulted in no adverse effects. No difference was noted in pain level, amount of oral intake, or pain on full jaw opening. Bupivacaine group patients received fewer though not statistically significant doses of pain medication than placebo group patients. We conclude that bupivacaine is a safe medication but offers no advantage in the control of early postoperative pain in adult patients undergoing local tonsillectomy. This controlled, randomised, double-blind study compared whether glossopharyngeal nerve block and intravenous morphine administered peri-operatively, decreased pain following elective adult tonsillectomy and uvulopalatoplasty more than morphine alone. Sixteen of 30 patients undergoing uvulopalatoplasty and 38 of 78 patients having tonsillectomy received bilateral glossopharyngeal nerve blocks, using bupivacaine 0.5% and adrenaline 1:200,000, or no intervention. There were no differences in postoperative analgesic consumption between the two groups. Visual analogue pain scores measured during swallowing in the recovery room and on the ward postoperatively were significantly less overall in uvulopalatoplasty patients who had received a block (p = 0.004). This difference was not found for tonsillectomy. We found no significant differences between groups, in pain scores recorded during the first 5 days at home. We conclude that glossopharyngeal block does not improve analgesia following tonsillectomy although there is short-lived benefit following uvulopalatoplasty. The efficacy of benzydamine hydrochloride (Difflam) spray to relieve pain from postoperative tonsillectomy was assessed, but it was found that it did not relieve the symptoms after operation when compared to matching placebo. Since pre-incisional peritonsillar infiltrations of local anesthetic solutions have been suggested to reduce postoperative pain after tonsillectomy, we compared the efficacy of either pre- or postoperative local anesthetic infiltration upon post-tonsillectomy pain.\n                After the induction of general anesthesia, 68 consecutive healthy patients, ranging in age from 8 to 65 years, were randomly allocated to either receive peritonsillar infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine (group 1) or normal saline (group 2) before incision. A third group (group 3) had their peritonsillar region infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine after the completion of surgery but before the patients were awakened from anesthesia. All the patients were treated in the same way in the postoperative period: NSAIDs were given intravenously to adults and rectally to children. Acetaminophen was given intravenously or rectally (children aged < 15 yr) if additional analgesic support was requested by the patient. Additional acetaminophen consumption was recorded daily. Pain scores were assessed on every patient with the use of a visual analogue scale (VAS) at rest, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 and 36 h after surgery, and also on swallowing during the first postoperative day.\n                Global VAS pain scores were lower in the groups treated with bupivacaine infiltration during the first 24 h after surgery (P < 0.05). Supplementary analgesic consumption was lower in group 3 than in group 2 during the 0-9 h interval immediately following surgery (P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences for any other parameters between the 3 groups.\n                These results suggest that the timing of peritonsillar infiltration with bupivacaine is not of clinical importance and does not affect the quality of postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing tonsillectomy.",

After a 2-wk run-in period, 780 patients with COPD were randomized to receive for 12 wk formoterol dry powder 12 or 24 microg twice daily, ipratropium bromide 40 microg four times daily, or placebo in a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study. The primary efficacy variable was the area under the curve for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) measured over 12 h after 12 wk of treatment. Secondary variables included diary symptoms and quality of life. Both doses of formoterol and ipratropium significantly increased the area under the curve for FEV(1) in comparison with placebo (all p < 0.001). Both doses of formoterol were also significantly superior to ipratropium (all p < 0.025). Compared with placebo, both doses of formoterol significantly improved symptoms (all p < or = 0.007) and quality of life (p < 0.01 for total scores) whereas ipratropium did not show significant effects (all p > or = 0.3). All study treatments exhibited a similar safety profile. We conclude that formoterol is more effective than ipratropium bromide in the treatment of COPD, as the efficacy of ipratropium on airflow obstruction does not translate into a clinical benefit that patients can perceive. To examine and compare the efficacy and safety of salmeterol xinafoate, a long-acting inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonist, with inhaled ipratropium bromide and inhaled placebo in patients with COPD.\n                A stratified, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial.\n                Multiple sites at clinics and university medical centers throughout the United States.\n                Four hundred eleven symptomatic patients with COPD with FEV1 < or = 65% predicted and no clinically significant concurrent disease. Interventions: Comparison of inhaled salmeterol (42 microg twice daily), inhaled ipratropium bromide (36 microg four times a day), and inhaled placebo (2 puffs four times a day) over 12 weeks.\n                Salmeterol xinafoate was significantly (p < 0.0001) better than placebo and ipratropium in improving lung function at the recommended doses over the 12-week trial. Both salmeterol and ipratropium reduced dyspnea related to activities of daily living compared with placebo; this improvement was associated with reduced use of supplemental albuterol. Analyses of time to first COPD exacerbation revealed salmeterol to be superior to placebo and ipratropium (p < 0.05). Adverse effects were similar among the three treatments.\n                These collective data support the use of salmeterol as first-line bronchodilator therapy for the long-term treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition in which continuous bronchodilation may have clinical advantages. This study evaluated salmeterol, a beta-agonist bronchodilator with a duration of action substantially longer than that of short-acting beta-agonists, compared with ipratropium, an anticholinergic bronchodilator, and placebo in patients with COPD. Four hundred and five patients with COPD received either salmeterol 42 microg twice daily, ipratropium bromide 36 microg four times daily, or placebo for 12 wk in this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Patients were stratified on the basis of bronchodilator response to albuterol (> 12% and > 200-ml improvement) and were randomized within each stratum. Bronchodilator response was measured over 12 h four times during the treatment period. Salmeterol provided similar maximal bronchodilatation to ipratropium but had a longer duration of action and a more constant bronchodilatory effect with no evidence of bronchodilator tolerance. Both active treatments were well tolerated. Salmeterol was an effective bronchodilator with a consistent effect over this 12-wk study in patients with COPD, including those \"unresponsive\" to albuterol. The long duration of action of salmeterol offers the advantage of twice daily dosing compared with the required four times a day dosing with ipratropium. The efficacy and safety of salmeterol alone was compared with the combination of salmeterol plus ipratropium and with placebo during long-term treatment in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, the single-dose effect in response to the first dose of treatment was studied over 12 h. The patients (n=144; age 64+/-7 yrs, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 44+/-11% pred) participated in a three-centre double-blind double-placebo parallel group study and were randomized after a run-in period of 2 weeks to receive either salmeterol 50 microg b.i.d., salmeterol 5 microg b.i.d. plus ipratropium 40 microg q.i.d. or placebo for a period of 12 weeks. The single-dose study demonstrated that salmeterol produced a significant increase in FEV1 (peak of 7% pred) and specific airway conductance (sGaw) (maximum of 60% baseline) for > or =12 h. The combination of salmeterol plus ipratropium elicited a greater bronchodilator response (11% and 94% increases respectively) than salmeterol alone during the first 6 h after inhalation. During treatment there were significant improvements in daytime symptom scores and morning peak expiratory flow in both the salmeterol and the salmeterol plus ipratropium groups (p<0.001), with an associated decrease in the use of rescue salbutamol. Improvements in FEV1 and sGaw were greater in the salmeterol plus ipratropium group than in the patients receiving only salmeterol. Thirty-five patients had an exacerbation; 11 (23%) in the salmeterol group (versus placebo NS), six (13%) in the salmeterol plus ipratropium group (versus placebo p<0.01) and 18 (36%) in the placebo group. In conclusion, in patients with severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long-term treatment with either salmeterol alone or salmeterol plus ipratropium is safe and effective. There was added benefit from the combination therapy in terms of improvement in airways obstruction, but not for improvement in symptom control or need for rescue salbutamol.",
        "target_summary": "The available data from the trials suggest that there is little difference between regular long term use of IpB alone and salmeterol if the aim is to improve COPD symptoms and exercise tolerance. However, salmeterol was more effective in improving lung function variables. In terms of post-bronchodilator lung function, combination therapy conferred modest benefits, a significant improvement in HRQL, and reduced supplemental short-acting beta-agonist requirement, although this effect was not consistent. Additional studies are needed to assess the relative effects of combining therapies, using validated subjective measurements, and should consider concordance and the convenience of people having to use different inhaler devices.",

        "document": "To assess the efficacy of corticosteroids in acute vestibular vertigo, we randomly selected 20 patients so that half took methylprednisolone and half took placebo. Extensive neurotologic examination confirmed the diagnosis. If no significant reduction of vertigo occurred within the first 24 hours of treatment, patients were instructed to switch medications. Patients were followed up prospectively for 1 month. Of the 10 patients receiving methylprednisolone, 9 had a marked reduction of vertiginous symptoms and 1 switched to the placebo medication. Of the 10 patients receiving placebo, 3 had relief of vertiginous symptoms, while the 7 with persistent symptoms switched to methylprednisolone and had subsequent effective reduction of vertigo within 24 hours. The electronystagmogram returned to normal within 1 month in all 16 patients taking methylprednisolone, but remained abnormal in 2 of the 4 patients treated with placebo. One patient receiving methylprednisolone had a relapse of symptoms when the dosage was tapered, but symptoms again remitted when the dosage was increased to 32 mg/d. From this double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we conclude that methylprednisolone is much more effective than placebo in reducing vertiginous symptoms in patients with acute vestibular vertigo. To evaluate the value of corticosteroids in the treatment of vestibular neuritis (VN).\n                Prospective controlled randomized.\n                Thirty VN patients, 15 in the study and 15 in the control group, were the subjects of the study. The study group was treated by 1 mg/kg prednisone for 5 days, followed by gradually reduced doses of prednisone for an additional 15 days, and vestibular sedatives for symptomatic relief during the first 5 days after presentation. The control group received a placebo and similar vestibular sedatives. The patients had a baseline evaluation and follow-up examinations after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The groups were compared for the presence of symptoms and signs, caloric lateralization on the electronystagmography (ENG), the presence of other pathologic findings in the ENG, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores.\n                No differences were found between the groups in the occurrence of symptoms and signs, degree of caloric lateralization, presence of other ENG pathologic findings, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores at the end of the study. Complete resolution was observed in 64% of the study and in 80% of the control group. The study group showed earlier recovery of ENG lateralization at the 1- and 3-month follow-up evaluations and higher rates of complete resolution at the 3- and 6-month follow-up points.\n                Prednisone therapy might enhance earlier recovery but does not improve the long-term prognosis of VN. The clinical and laboratory parameters in VN are not correlated, and both are required for complete patient evaluation. Vestibular neuritis is the second most common cause of peripheral vestibular vertigo. Its assumed cause is a reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection. Therefore, corticosteroids, antiviral agents, or a combination of the two might improve the outcome in patients with vestibular neuritis.\n                We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, two-by-two factorial trial in which patients with acute vestibular neuritis were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo, methylprednisolone, valacyclovir, or methylprednisolone plus valacyclovir. Vestibular function was determined by caloric irrigation, with the use of the vestibular paresis formula (to measure the extent of unilateral caloric paresis) within 3 days after the onset of symptoms and 12 months afterward.\n                Of a total of 141 patients who underwent randomization, 38 received placebo, 35 methylprednisolone, 33 valacyclovir, and 35 methylprednisolone plus valacyclovir. At the onset of symptoms there was no difference among the groups in the severity of vestibular paresis. The mean (+/-SD) improvement in peripheral vestibular function at the 12-month follow-up was 39.6+/-28.1 percentage points in the placebo group, 62.4+/-16.9 percentage points in the methylprednisolone group, 36.0+/-26.7 percentage points in the valacyclovir group, and 59.2+/-24.1 percentage points in the methylprednisolone-plus-valacyclovir group. Analysis of variance showed a significant effect of methylprednisolone (P<0.001) but not of valacyclovir (P=0.43). The combination of methylprednisolone and valacyclovir was not superior to corticosteroid monotherapy.\n                Methylprednisolone significantly improves the recovery of peripheral vestibular function in patients with vestibular neuritis, whereas valacyclovir does not.\n                Copyright 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society",

Twenty babies in the treatment group received 2.5 mg/kg of gentamicin sulfate every six hours for one week after birth, and 22 babies received dextrose-and-water placebo in an equivalently small volume. None of the 20 gentamicin-treated babies developed NEC. Four of the control babies did. Two of these babies died, and their diagnosis was pathologically confirmed. This difference in the incidence of NEC between the treatment and control group was significant at the .05 level. These results support the prophylactic use of orally given gentamicin for selected babies at high risk for NEC, particularly those born prematurely and those who have a history of perinatal asphyxia or umbilical artery catheterization or both. Continued surveillance for changes in antimicrobial sensitivity patterns is recommended. To evaluate the effectiveness of oral vancomycin in the prophylaxis of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm, very low birthweight infants.\n                A prospective, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study in a tertiary referral centre of a university teaching hospital was conducted on 140 very low birthweight infants consecutively admitted to the neonatal unit. The babies were randomly allocated to receive oral vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 7 days) or an equivalent volume of placebo solution. Prophylaxis was started 24 hours before the start of oral feeds. All suspected cases of necrotising enterocolitis were investigated with a full sepsis screen and serial abdominal radiographs. Necrotising enterocolitis was diagnosed and staged according to modified Bell's criteria.\n                Nine of 71 infants receiving oral vancomycin and 19 of 69 infants receiving the placebo solution developed necrotising enterocolitis (p = 0.035). Infants with necrotising enterocolitis were associated with a significant increase in mortality (p = 0.026) and longer duration of hospital stay (p = 0.002).\n                Prophylactic oral vancomycin conferred protection against necrotising enterocolitis in preterm, very low birthweight infants and was associated with a 50% reduction in the incidence. However, widespread implementation of this preventive measure is not recommended, as it would only be effective in necrotising enterocolitis caused by Gram positive organisms and could increase the danger of the emergence of vancomycin resistant or dependent organisms. Its use should be restricted to a high prevalence nursery for a short and well defined period in a selected group of high risk patients.",

Sixty cases of CHM classified as high risk were recruited and randomly allocated to a chemoprophylactic or control group. Within one week after evacuation of molar tissues, actinomycin D was administered in the chemoprophylactic group. Patients in the control group were given only intravenous fluid and analgesic drugs. The number of patients with malignant sequelae who required therapeutic chemotherapy after evacuation of hydatidiform mole in each group was recorded.\n                The incidence of malignant sequelae was 13.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.9-31.7%) in the chemoprophylactic group and 50.0% (95% CI = 31.3-68.7%) in the control group. The risk reduction of malignant sequelae with one course of actinomycin D chemoprophylaxis in high-risk CHM was 72.4% (95% CI = 26.7-89.6%) (P = .005). The side effects of prophylactic chemotherapy were stomatitis, nausea/vomiting, sore throat with oral ulcer and hair loss.\n                One course of actinomycin D given as chemoprophylaxis decreased by 72.4% malignant sequelae after evacuation of molar tissue in patients with high-risk CHM. This may be particularly beneficial in patients with high-risk CHM who cannot be followed closely, whose compliance is in question and for whom hormonal follow-up is not available or unreliable. Seventy-one patients with complete hydatidiform mole were prospectively randomized into two groups: one group (39 patients) was treated with a single course of methotrexate and citrovorum factor rescue as chemoprophylaxis; the other group (32 patients) was not treated. After molar evacuation, four patients from the treated group (10.3%) and ten patients from the untreated group (31.3%) developed persistent trophoblastic disease. The time interval from evacuation of the mole to diagnosis of persistent trophoblastic disease was longer in the treated group than in the untreated group (9.5 +/- 2.4 weeks versus 5.1 +/- 1.6 weeks, P less than .05). Among high-risk patients, there was a lower incidence of persistent trophoblastic disease in the treated group than in the untreated group (14.3 versus 47.4%, P less than .05). Among low-risk patients there was no difference between the groups (5.6 versus 7.7%, P greater than .05). All 14 patients with persistent trophoblastic disease achieved complete remission with therapeutic chemotherapy. More courses of chemotherapy were required until complete remission in the treated group than in the untreated group (2.5 +/- 0.5 versus 1.4 +/- 0.5, P less than .005). These findings suggest that even though chemoprophylaxis reduces the incidence of persistent trophoblastic disease in patients at high risk, it increases tumor resistance and morbidity. Although prophylactic chemotherapy with methotrexate and citrovorum factor rescue may be helpful for high-risk patients who cannot be followed or whose compliance is in question, careful follow-up remains the most important way to identify patients who should receive chemotherapy. The effectiveness of the prophylactic chemotherapy was evaluated in 420 patients with molar pregnancy. All patients were followed for 5 to 15 years after the evacuation. Twenty-two (7.5%) of 293 patients with prophylactic chemotherapy and 23 (18.1%) of 127 patients without prophylactic chemotherapy (control) developed secondary trophoblastic disease. The prophylactic chemotherapy could reduce the occurrence of secondary trophoblastic disease. In these secondary trophoblastic diseases, 5 (22.7%) of 22 patients in the prophylactic chemotherapy group and 5 (21.7%) of 23 in the control had metastatic trophoblastic disease. Choriocarcinoma after the molar pregnancy developed in two patients (0.7%) of the prophylactic chemotherapy group and two (1.6%) of the control. Prophylactic chemotherapy did not eliminate the occurrence of choriocarcinoma. The complication of the prophylactic chemotherapy was seen in 27.3% of the patients. Neither severe complication nor death were related to the toxicity.",

An 18% reduction in daily sputum production (P less than 0.003) was observed on treatment with inhaled steroid compared to placebo. A small, significant, improvement in morning peak expiratory flow rate (P less than 0.03) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (P less than 0.03) was seen but the absolute changes are unlikely to be of clinical importance. Symptom scores for cough improved significantly (P less than 0.02). Inhaled steroids may have a role in the management of bronchiectasis by reducing cough and sputum production. Although corticosteroid therapy might be clinically beneficial for bronchiectasis, very little is known of its effects on the inflammatory and infective markers in bronchiectasis. We have therefore performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of a 4-wk administration of inhaled fluticasone in bronchiectasis. Twenty-four patients (12 female; mean age 51 yr) were randomized into receiving either inhaled fluticasone (500 microgram twice daily) via the Accuhaler device (n = 12) or placebo. At each visit, spirometry, 24-h sputum volume, sputum leukocyte density, bacterial densities, and concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were determined. There was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in sputum leukocyte density and IL-1beta, IL-8, and LTB4 after fluticasone treatment. The fluticasone group had one and the placebo group three episodes of exacerbation. There were no significant changes in spirometry (p > 0.05) or any reported adverse reactions in either group. The results of this study show that high-dose fluticasone is effective in reducing the sputum inflammatory indices in bronchiectasis. Large-scale and long-term studies are indicated to evaluate the effects of inhaled steroid therapy on the inflammatory components in bronchiectasis. While exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) levels are reduced by inhaled corticosteroid therapy in asthma, such treatment effect is unclear in bronchiectasis.\n                Stable non-smoking bronchiectasis patients were randomised to receive either fluticasone (1 mg/daily) or identical placebo via the Accuhaler device.\n                Sixty non-smoking patients (38 women; mean age 56.4 +/- 12.7 years) were recruited. Of these, half received inhaled fluticasone and half placebo therapy. eNO was measured using a chemiluminescence analyser at 0, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks. There was no significant difference in eNO levels between fluticasone and placebo patients over the study period. There was no correlation between baseline eNO with age, FEV1, FVC, 24 h sputum volume or number of bronchiectatic segments. Patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection, but not their counterparts, displayed a correlation between 0- and 52-week eNO levels. PA infection was associated with significantly lower eNO levels among the patients.\n                Inhaled fluticasone therapy, despite being an effective anti-inflammatory agent, has no significant effect on eNO production, either at individual time points or over the entire 52-week profile, in bronchiectasis. It appears that eNO might not reflect the extent of airway inflammation in bronchiectasis. The clinical efficacy of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment has not been evaluated in bronchiectasis, despite the presence of chronic airway inflammation.\n                After three consecutive weekly visits, 86 patients were randomised to receive either fluticasone 500 mug twice daily (n = 43, 23F, mean (SD) age 57.7 (14.4) years) or matched placebo (n = 43, 34F, 59.2 (14.2) years) and reviewed regularly for 52 weeks in a double blind fashion.\n                35 and 38 patients in the fluticasone and placebo groups completed the study. Significantly more patients on ICS than on placebo showed improvement in 24 hour sputum volume (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.0, p = 0.03) but not in exacerbation frequency, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, or sputum purulence score. Significantly more patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection receiving fluticasone showed improvement in 24 hour sputum volume (OR 13.5, 95% CI 1.8 to 100.2, p = 0.03) and exacerbation frequency (OR 13.3, 95% CI 1.8 to 100.2, p = 0.01) than those given placebo. Logistic regression models revealed a significantly better response in sputum volume with fluticasone treatment than with placebo among subgroups of patients with 24 hour sputum volume <30 ml (p = 0.04), exacerbation frequency </=2/year (p = 0.04), and sputum purulence score >5 (p = 0.03).\n                ICS treatment is beneficial to patients with bronchiectasis, particularly those with P. aerurginosa infection. The effects of inhaled steroids upon the quality of life of patients with bronchiectasis remain unknown.\n                To analyze the effect of inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP) for 6 months upon the clinical, functional, microbiological and outcome parameters of patients with steady-state bronchiectasis not due to cystic fibrosis, and its repercussions for patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\n                Prospective, randomized, double-blind (for effective doses) study.\n                The diagnosis of bronchiectasis was made by high-resolution computed tomography. Ninety-three patients (mean age: 68.5 [8.4]) were randomized to receive 250 microg bid, 500 microg bid or no treatment with inhaled FP for 6 months. Data were collected at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. HRQoL was assessed using the validated Spanish version of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire.\n                The group administered FP 1000 microg daily showed significant improvement in dyspnea (1.03 [2.1]-1.24 [2.2] points; P = 0.01-0.04), sputum production (P = 0.001), days without cough (P = 0.02) and short-acting beta-2 agonists used (P = 0.01) from the first month of treatment, with no changes in pulmonary function, number or severity of exacerbations, or microbiological profile of the sputum. As a result, an improvement in HRQoL was seen in this group after 3 months of treatment (45.4 [14.2] vs. 40.5 [13.9]; P = 0.01).\n                Inhalatory FP 500 microg bid is effective from the first month of treatment for controlling the symptoms of patients with steady-state bronchiectasis-thus ensuring a significant improvement in HRQoL.",

The evaluation was carried out by measuring the amplitude of the compound motor action potential (CMAP), as well as by observing the initial and final HB grade, at days 4, 7 and 15 after onset of facial palsy.\n                Patients belonging to the rehabilitation group clearly showed an overall improvement of clinical stage at the planned final observation, i.e. 15 days after onset of facial palsy, without presenting greater values of CMAP. ABSTRACT Limited evidence may support the application of electrical stimulation in the subacute and chronic stages of facial palsy, yet some physiotherapists in South Africa have been applying this modality in the acute stage in the absence of published evidence of clinical efficacy. This preliminary study's aim was to determine the safety and potential efficacy of applying electrical stimulation to the facial muscles during the early phase of Bells palsy. A pretest posttest control vs. experimental groups design composed of 16 patients with Bell's palsy of less than 30 days' duration. Adult patients with clinical diagnosis of Bell's palsy were systematically (every second patient) allocated to the control and experimental groups. Each group (n = 8) was pretested and posttested using the House-Brackmann index. Both groups were treated with heat, massage, exercises, and a home program. The experimental group also received electrical stimulation. The House-Brackmann Scale of the control group improved between 17% and 50% with a mean of 30%. The scores of the experimental group ranged between 17% and 75% with a mean of 37%. The difference between the groups was not statistically significant (two-tailed p = 0.36). Electrical stimulation as used in this study during the acute phase of Bell's palsy is safe but may not have added value over spontaneous recovery and multimodal physiotherapy.

Patients were randomly divided into two groups: control (n = 30) and experimental (n = 29).\n                Control group patients received conventional therapeutic measures while the facial neuromuscular re-education group patients received techniques that were tailored to each patient in three sessions per day for six days per week for a period of two weeks.\n                All the patients were evaluated using a Facial Grading Scale before treatment and after three months.\n                The Facial Grading Scale scores showed significant improvement in both control (mean 32 (range 9.7-54) to 54.5 (42.2-71.7)) and the experimental (33 (18-43.5) to 66 (54-76.7)) group. Facial Grading Scale change scores showed that experimental group (27.5 (20-43.77)) improved significantly more than the control group (16.5 (12.2-24.7)). Analysis of Facial Grading Scale subcomponents did not show statistical significance, except in the movement score (12 (8-16) to 24 (12-18)).\n                Individualized facial neuromuscular re-education is more effective in improving facial symmetry in patients with Bell's palsy than conventional therapeutic measures.",
        "target_summary": "There is no high quality evidence to support significant benefit or harm from any physical therapy for idiopathic facial paralysis. There is low quality evidence that tailored facial exercises can help to improve facial function, mainly for people with moderate paralysis and chronic cases. There is low quality evidence that facial exercise reduces sequelae in acute cases. The suggested effects of tailored facial exercises need to be confirmed with good quality randomised controlled trials.",

        "document": "In 94 patients with femoral neck fracture the vitality of the femoral head was determined pre- and postoperatively with 99mTc-MDP-scintimetry. In half of the fractures a Thornton nail was used, in the other half three Scand hip pins. Irrespective of the displacement, no difference was noted in the two groups. In half of the operations in each group the fracture was impacted by hammer at the end of the operation. In displaced fractures, impaction caused a decrease in femoral head vitality. In a prospective study of 220 displaced femoral neck fractures treated with a sliding-screw-plate, the cases were allocated to osteosynthesis with or without compression. In surviving patients followed for at least 1 year, union occurred in 57/85 with compression and 58/71 without compression. At 2 years, necrosis was radiographically evident in 9/37 and 7/36 united fractures. Thus, compression cannot be recommended when displaced femoral neck fractures are treated with a sliding-screw-plate. We have compared the results and complications after closed and open reduction with ternal fixation in young adults with displaced intracapsular fractures (Garden grades III and IV) of the neck of the femur. We also studied the risk factors which influenced nonunion and the development of avascular necrosis (AVN). A total of 102 patients aged between 15 and 50 years was randomised to receive either closed or open reduction. Both groups were compared for age, gender, time to surgery and posterior comminution as well as for union and complications. Using univariate and multivariate analysis the factors influencing nonunion and AVN were assessed. Of the 102 patients, 92 were available for review. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of union (p = 0.93) and AVN at two years (p = 0.85). Posterior comminution, poor reduction and improper placement of the screws were the major factors contributing to nonunion. The overall incidence of AVN was 16.3% (15 of 92 patients) and it was not influenced by these factors. A delay of more than 48 hours before surgery did not influence the rate of union or the development of AVN when compared with operation within 48 hours of injury.",
        "target_summary": "Insufficient evidence exists from randomised trials to confirm the relative effects of open versus closed reduction of intracapsular fractures, or the effects of intra-operative impaction or compression of an intracapsular fracture treated by internal fixation.",
